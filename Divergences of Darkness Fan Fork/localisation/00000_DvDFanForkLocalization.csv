#####lessons_of_the_german_revolution_desc;The German Revolution was a event that took place in Frankfurt in the late 18th Century that had been utterly crushed after several catastrophic failures from its leadership. As such, Liberalism has never been seen as important as it was in OTL and unless another revolution were to occur it may never be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#####500000.T;Venice wants to buy Durrës;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#####500000.D;The city of Durrës has a history of Venetian control. Interspersed with Serbian, Epirote, Anjou and Albanian control, Venice controled the city. Gained after the Fourth Crusade, but lost soon after. In 1392 the city was recaptured and only being lost in 1501 when the expanding Ottomans conquered the city. With the Ottomans gone, Venice is now looking to regain the city. Whilst we do need the money, it is clear that the loss of our major port would mean the influence of Venice upon our country would become even more massive. Were we to accept, soon, we will loose our independence all together.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ANI1.T;Leif Erikson's day;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ANI1.D;900 years ago Vinland was discovered and named by Leif Erikson, son of the settler of Greenland, Erik the Red, after he had seen wild grapes on the shore he landed. While much of his life is unknown apart from some unreliable sagas, and the Vinlanders of old gone, the figure of Leif has been hailed as a national hero since the times of the first settlers. With no precise day for the discovery except that it was fall, the date of Leif's Day was settled by the Vinlandic Parliament to be celebrated on the day before the anniversary of the independence of Vinland on the 17th September. All years the 17th and 18th September are days of celebrations and pride for all people of Vinland. But to mark the canonial date, a replica of a Viking ship has sailed from Iceland to Erikshavn where his arrival was met with an immense and joyous crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAF2D;Fishing has been the lifeblood for many in the North Sea. It's plentiful bounty, been competed for from generations of fisherman. But although such is the waters plenty, it has never been without it's territorial ambition.\nIn Trondheim, this was seen today, as a large fishing fleet of Scottish Fishers had came to port, only to be met with anger and fiery words by local Fisherman, who have sworn the Scottish were poaching upon their healthy waters. Words became blows, blows became fights, fights became riots.\nBy the end of the night, the port was rushing with action of a more violent nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCAF3D;Although the Urban Centres of Scotland have been centres of industry, commerce & good relations with the Scots for Centures. The various Clans of Scotland has been a weaving of loyalties, blood rivalries & even wars from the Highlands to the Lowlands. The most our efforts have led to were the exile of Clan Mackay, Dunbar & the Fraser's to Sydoe.\nBut now, the drunken tirades of the Heir of Clan McRaith, and the reacting drunken murder of a member of G?rdanaich once more seems to have Scotland on the brink of another series of clan wars, and with the weaving of alliances threatening to bring in various more across the country, this might just be the largest yet!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCAF5D;Nowhere else in Europe did the need for Orangerie's dominate the various estates more than Scandinavia, for over 400 years they have been the homes of the most Northern Citrus tree's in the world, protected by the cold & snow. Although times have changed.\nWith the advent of refridgeration, cheaper & quicker freights, fruits and vegetables around the world are making it into the pantry's of Scandinavians across the Metropolitan.

BRGF1D;Charles de Fourcroy, born in Lun?ville, Lorraine, has finally written his 'magnum opus' after decades of petitioning everyone from universities to dukes to sponsor his writings. Charles has always endorsed the belief that the conflict between Burgundy & England-France is a conflict 'between brothers & family', and has always supported a 'Union of Franks'.\n\n'Francolangian: An International Language for all Franks', is the work of said writer, detailing the history of both Burgundian & French languages, it then translates further on, into a detailed dictionary & sentence-creation in his personal, artificial hybridized language, Francolangia, in which he says will 'solve the conflict & history of all Frankish speakers for centuries', He's even started to call himself a Francolangian to support the 'Pan-Frankish' case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUSF1.T;History of Russia from the Earliest Times;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
RUSF1.D;Mikhail Godanin has eventually published the last of the 31 volumes of his History of Russia, considered by many its magnum opus. Son of a former serf, Godanin managed throughout his life to rise through his academic brilliance and his knowledge of the new Western historical methods. His History of Russia is notable for its disdain and refute of the so-called Normanist theory. Many Western historians who had worked on the history of Russia before had noticed the importance of the Northmen in the build of the Rus. But Godanin has demonstrated that this was but a Scandinavian fabrication: Riourik he affirms was a Slav or a Finn, but not a Northman. Moreover, the Russians were already building their own state, and the Rurikids only unified and accelerated the historical process despite the marauding Varangians. This book has become the new Bible of the intellectuals in Russia and has helped nourish the already existing bad blood between Copenhagen and the Eastern Slavs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUSF3.D;A new fashion has emerged in the higher level of societies in the past few years. Whereas for nearly a century, the Russian boyars always were clean-shaven, many have chosen to grow the beard again. This social custom was never mandatory despite the rumours that some fools in Western Europe wrote that the Princes in Russia had their nobles forcefully shaven.  It was merely an attempt from the Russian elites to grow closer to Western aristocracy following their European tours in the late XVIIIth century, and allowed them to differentiate them quite easily from the common folk. Now the beard is seen as a Slavic symbol, showing that the elites have not abandoned their roots and understand the glory of the Russian people and its past. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC1.T;The Inca claimant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC1.D;Quiso Yupanqui was destined to rule the Inca empire as the first born of Huascar III. However his cowardice in the battle of Lima saw him discredited at court, many blaming him for the defeat. He was thus exiled and his uncle Huayna Capac IV was crowned in his stead. For 11 years we have hosted him in Camelot, granting him a small allowance but recently he has grown restless about taking back the throne of the Inca. Reports talk about unrest from the chieftains following the reforms of the Imperial court, and the ilness of the usurper. Quiso has demanded we help him arm his supporters so he could take back what is ours, and ensuring a more friendly, if not open to new ideas neighbour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC3.D;The coup has succeeded. Quiso himself slaughtered the usurper and his son despite the formidable defense of the Chinu guard and its commander, the Ronin Oishi Chikara. All administrators were interrogated, with the Qingqiuan Yiang Jujiu minister and first preceptor of the Prince executed for betraying the Empire in favour of the foreigners. The country soon rallied around his true ruler who has promised to uphold the natural balance of the Andine society, reverting several modernization reforms of his predecessors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC4.T;The Great Andine Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC4.D;The Inca empire in the Andes is suffering from a great famine following an outbreak of potato blight. Potatoes have suffered in the past from diseases, but never on such a scale and the inefficient and closed governement of Quiso Capac has only worsened the situation. All around the empire the peasants turn to the God of the Sun to relieve them of their pains but so far no sign of amelioration has been seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC7.D;The disastrous administration of Quiso Qapac has led to a grave famine in the Andes.

New-Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions as they hosted several foreign communities, and shipments of food flooded the port. However the campaigns outside never saw much of it as Beornian bureaucrats took lands by force from the inhabitants. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army was free to destroy villages and accaparate land for future colonization with countless tribes pushed to the North. When the Beornians did not act, entire villages were left to starve, resulting in one of the most brutal massacres of the XIXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC13.T;The first Imperial assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.D;One of the reforms pushed by Pachacuti II was the establishment of an Assembly to represent the people of the Empire in governance. It first convened in $YEAR$, with a Lower Chamber elected by the various Ayllus of the Empire and a Senate appointed by the Emperor. The campaigns voted by villages with no individual votes cast, while in the Imperial cities only those who payed the 'poll tax' could vote. The first Inca constitution while deeply influenced by the European and Japanese models, retained several of the particularities of the Empire and established the so-called era of the 'advised Sapa Incas'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC13.A;The voice of the people is the will of the Inka!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.T;The gate of the empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.D;Following the loss of the Inka homeland to the Spanish, the Empire strenghtened its hold on the South. In the southern valley of the new Antisuyu the bay of Uraycusta was first developed by Dongese who had acquired trading privileges following the establishment of the Chinu guard. Following the crossing of Land's End and the treaty of Bordeaux that saw the Anglois gain access to Potosi silver, Uraycusta grew even further. Eventually by the XVIIIth century and the arrival of the Japanese traders in the region, it had been nicknamed the 'Gate of the Inca' by outsiders as this was the only port accessible to foreigners. The reforms of Pachacuti targeted the city the city plan was reorganized and the city was given self governance like the Imperial capital, free from the Southern Apu (governor) as to encourage foreign investments and settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC14.A;Let the world come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.T;Rice farming in Antisuyu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC15.D;Rice was brought to the knowledge of the Inca following the arrival of Dongese merchants and adventurers in the late XIVth century but cultivation was sporadic as few Ayllus and administrators wanted to cultivate this new plant. But in Antisuyu the climate has revealed itself as a good match for the plant and the Asiatic and Qingqiuan presence in the city meant that the cereal was in demand. In the 1840's Pachacuti II, who was a well known consumer of rice, developed great infrastructure projects to enlarge the production of rice in the South. This effort led to an increase of food that allowed the Empire to avoid disaster during the Potato blight of the late 1840's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC16.T;The last Silver fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.D;The only diplomatic tool that the Empire had following the conquest of Cuzco was the great silver mines of the Andes and especially Potosi. While payments to the Spanish were stopped as soon as the Colombian wars began, the Anglois fleet still continued to come every 4 years to take its due. Pachacuti II arranged following his coronation for a diplomat to be sent to Paris to end the treaty to show its regained independence. The Anglois accepted as their reliance on silver had been reduced thanks to Atlantian and Qingqiuan gold flooding the markets with only the payment for $YEAR$ to be done. Now the Silver fleet has left the port of Uraycusta for the last time, with a day of celebrations in the empire for the end of European colonialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC16.A;Tawantinsuyu will not be exploited anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.T;The last Silver fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.D;The Dual-Monarchy had gained access to the Potosi silver in the XVIIth century, securing payments of silver in exchange for guarantees of the Inca Empire continued independence. As silver became less of a necessity thanks to the various Gold rushes, the interest of the Silver fleets declined for Anglois elites. Following the accession of the new Incan emperor Pachacuti II, diplomats agreed to end the old treaty of Bordeaux in exchange for a last shipment and preferential relations with the new 'civilized state';;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC17.A;It was good while it lasted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.T;The Great Land Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.D;Before the arrival of the Conquistadors the Incan economy was not based on individual property and markets, but on the basis of reciprocity between individuals, but also inside the Empire as a whole. The corvée, or mit'ma, was in theory based on the fact that in bad times the emperor would help the communities who worked for him. This system was brutally changed by the Conquest and the spread of European thoughts as the chieftains acquired more lands from the community for themselves. Pachacuti invested several administrators to the creation of a modern cadaster and the end of nobility hegemony on land possession. The mit'ma was also formally abolished. The Ayllus were left with a choice : the lands were divided between the various families of the villages or instituted as common land possessed by the entire village. A mixed system of landowning prevailed after the reforms, granting far more power to the peasant communities than before and ensuring a greater food production.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC18.A;Lands owned by communes, what a strange idea.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.T;Feeding the empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.D;The various reforms of Pachacuti and the adoption of foreign and modern agricultural techniques allowed the Empire to grow far more food than before, accompanying the growth of population. The Empire while not controlling the food market as before still exerted great influence over the merchants, instituting maximum prices during times of hunger and ensuring redistribution of food for isolated communities in periods of drought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC19.A;Our people is fed and growing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.T;Ending the colonial system;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.D;The reconquest of old imperial lands up to Quito proved to be a major problem for the Empire of the Sun. The economy was controlled by the Granadan and catholic Quechua elites who abused the rural communities to gain more wealth. In the same time the Catholic faith proved to be hard to manage as bishops rallied the masses against the 'Heathen invaders' adoring idols and devils. To counterract both of these problems, the land reform that had been instituted in the Southern Andes was extended to Peru, with the resisting landowners being put to trial or even murdered in riots where the injustice was the worst. Meanwhile the Catholic masses grew less poor thanks to the Inka, securing the loyalty of the rural communities. The land reform disrupted the economy of the Central Andes for nearly two decades as production had to be reorganized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC20.A;Colonization has ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.T;Renew the Chinu alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC21.D;The relations between the Qingqiuese and the Empire of the Sun go back to the XVth century when a Dongese ship landed near Quito, bringing the lost Chinese colonists in contact with their first non-hostile state after the disaster of Acapulco. Soon after disgruntled mercenaries from Dong Guo arrived to settle in the empire bringing variolation, gunpowder and mettalurgy to the Empire and forming the 'Chinu Guard', critical to the continued independence of the Inca Empire. After his accession to the throne Pachacuti II sent several ambassies to San Bao to rekindle their long friendship and secure a renewed alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

INC22.D;The Inca empire was the first non-hostile state the Chinese colonists encountered in the New-World, with Dongese ships avoiding the coast of Mexico following the slaughter of several crewmen in the bay of Acapulco. The Inca Empire brought food and ressources to the lost colonists, and many settled there, with also plenty of sailors marrying with Quechua women during their trips. The new era of Pacific navigation in the XVIIth century allowed the Qingqiuese to transport the Inca silver to China, greatly securing their trade adventures and ensuring the development of Qingqiu as it exists today. The reasons for allying the Inca are numerous and their ambassadors are ready to sign it as soon as we want it done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

humala_mission_desc;The Humala Mission or Humala Embassy was an Inca diplomatic journey to Japan, initiated in $YEAR$ by the Imperial court. Although it was not the only such "mission", it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Inca and the establishment of lasting relations between the two Empires of the Sun. It was first proposed by the influential head of the Chinu Guard Oishi . The purposes of the mission were twofold: To negotiate commercial treaties to increase trade in the Pacific and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from Japan who was considered as a model of successful and independent modernization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC23.T;The Humala mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC23.D;In $YEAR$, $COUNTRY$ hosted the Humala mission, an embassy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that aimed to negotiate new trade treaties and gather knowledge to assist them in their modernization. The chief of the embassy, Huascar Humala received an imperial audience and attracted great attention during his stay. While not the first Quechua to set foot in the Home Islands, nor the first embassy sent by the Empire of the Sun to the Empire of the Rising Sun, it sponsored growing ties between the two powers and became a symbol of their modernity for the Japanese elites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC23.A;Two empires closer under the Sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
INC24.T;Creation of the Liwru;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC24.D;By $YEAR$, the Inca state had transitioned into a dominated monetized economy. The economy minister implemented the creation of a paper-money backed by the huge silver and gold reserves gathered over the centuries. The money soon proved to be resilient and strong as the local population adopted it and international merchants used it for their Amerigan endeavours;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC24.A;Let the money flow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.T;Religion in the new Inca state;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.D;The cult of Inti, the sun god, has been the basis of the Inca religion since the foundation of the Empire. The emperors claim descent from Inti, with an old legacy of inbreeding to keep the blood of the god pure. Each ayllu worships huacas, mummified ancestors kept in the Imperial capital, and several other deities of the Andine pantheon. The relocation of the Empire to the South didn't change much as Christianity never truly took because of the tales of Spanish brutalities against the colonized populations of the western provinces. Pachacuti II guaranteed freedom of religion in the hopes of securing the loyalty of the Quechua in Granada and to please the European powers. This created some backlash from some of the religious elite but Pachacuti left all religious decisions to the Willaq Umu, the High Priest of Inti who spent the following years consolidate the Imperial religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC25.A;Is this still the empire of Inti ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC26.T;The Inti state religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC26.D;While the Sapa Inka officially left all religious affairs to the priests of Inti, only performating the rituals required by the tradition following the decision of Pachacuti II, this only strenghtened the cult in the long term. The various Willaq Umu, chosen by the Sapa Inka and reserved by tradition to members of the Imperial family, formalized the relationship between the gods and the Sapa Inka who became even more in the Imperial ideology a divine being who was separate from the rest of his subjects. The various cults of the Andes were left untouched by these changes, as the official religion only took care of the Imperial cults and especially the shrines of Inti. The Inti faith was reenforced by this new movement as the people took part in Inti ceremonies to demonstrate loyalty to the Empire while honoring their huacas and offering sacrifices to their local divinities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC27.D;The first task the Imperial officers prepared for after the reconquest of Cuzco was the preparations for the Festival of the Sun, the greatest ceremony of the Empire performed by the Sapa Inca himself on the winter solstice.

INC28.T;The Koricancha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC28.D;Back in the days of the old empire, the Willaq Umu performed their rituals in the golden temple, close to the Imperial palaces and in the true centre of the Empire. The Spanish demolished the temple, only leaving the foundations to build a church on it. While freedom of religion had been proclaimed and the Catholic cult was not persecuted anymore, the Imperial governement demolished the Church of Santo Francesco and planned a new Koricancha to be built. This act while heavily justified to the eyes of the Inti followers was met with rage by the Catholic faithful. The temple took nearly 15 years to be rebuilt, shining with gold and silver and being acclaimed as the herald of the new imperial architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC29.D;The return of the Imperial court to Cuzco saw numerous great works to embellish and make the old city a worthy capital for the Empire of the Sun. Among these works was the University of Cuzco, which soon became the centre of knowledge for the Empire as the first centre of higher learning of the empire. Several others spawned over the years but none as prestigious as the first Inca university.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC30.T;The Mountains of Death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC30.D;For decades the conquest of New-Mercia had been heralded as a great humanitarian project that had allowed civilization to flourish into the uncivilized Andes. But a recent report from a Burgundian missionary, Jean Casemer, who has spent 5 years in Native communities from the Andes has torn this facade apart. Collecting the tales of the great famine and the atrocities done by the Beornian army, he has personally scouted several abandoned villages 'meeting only death' for miles. His report was a blow to Beornian prestige although it did not amount to much as the Beornians never apologized or changed their stance about their Western provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As our mastery of the sea progresses, our contacts with the isolated island of Rapa Nui have grown, and many think that they are truly the islands of the myths.

INC61.D;The Mapudungun people have always fiercely resisted centralization, only coming together in timesof war to protect themselves from the invaders. As years go by, we have seen times changing. When we could resist the Inka, be they Quechua or Beornian, seems like a long time ago. The tribes accepted peace, even if it meant to see our enemies grow stronger. But now has come a formidable man, Lars Heyerdhal, a great explorer and commander who has heard of our plights and propose to wage war to recover our lost lands. A council of the main tribes of our country has declared him toqi, our leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC61.A;Long hail our savior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.T;Reports from the South...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
INC62.D;Troubled reports come from the Mapuche tribes. A man called Lars Heyerdhal coming from Scandinavia has seemingly been able to rally the tribes against our rule. Our contacts in the European embassies know nothing of this man who apparently was just a disillusioned immigrant in Camelot a few months ago. The Scandinavian attaché in Uraycusta pledges that he will get an official statement from his country, but he seems as lost as us on the situation. Our Foreign department is not so pleased by Scandinavian intervention. From their base of Tapt O, they have over the years sent several expeditions in the Southern Cone, and while there has been no official attempt to settle the place, the revolt of the Mapuche could very well be a pretext for Copenhagen to intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INC63.D;Strange news come from Southern Ameriga. In two days we have received a demand from clarification from our representative in the Incan Empire and a letter of friendship from the so-called King of Araucania and Patagonia, Karl-Lars von Heyerdhal. Reports seem to indicate that Lars Heyerdhal was months ago just a worthless subject of the Crown, but he has apparently taken over the Mapuche tribes as their king and want to expel the Incas from their lands. While he seems like a madman, he could serve our interests. Numerous tribes inhabit the Southern Cone : let them unite under a King of our obedience while we settle the Magellan strait. Or we could let the Southerners deal with this delusional King. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Either we recognize the Mapuche claims to independence and risk to see a Scandinavian colony on our southern border in a few years or fight but that will surely means that we will have to face the Scandinavian armies and also navy, along with the resistant Mapuche.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NAV1.T;Basque Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV1.D;Navarra is at the centre of influence conflicts since the Renaissance. Forsaken by the Spanish Crown which pursued its exploration policies, Navarra was both coveted by the king of Aragon and the Anglois Dual Monarchy. Aragon attacked first and invaded Higher-Navarra in 1508. The queen from Navarra fled to her possessions in Aquitaine, Lower-Navarra. Before war erupted, a compromise was found between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy in Perpignan: The Anglo-French would annex Lower-Navarra while the queen of Navarra would pledge fidelity to the king of Aragon. Over the centuries, the political setup did not change much, with Navarra using its three neighbours against each other to preserve some independence, like with Henri III who took part in the Wars of Religion. But now, Aragon is the shadow of itself, not even considered as a Great Power by many. The king Henry IV thinks he can profit from it, by pulling his Anglo-French and Spanish allies to help him.

NAV9.T;Revolution?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV9.D;Crowds were filling the streets of Navarra as a reaction to the broken promise of independence of the Basque people. At first, the police and the military tried to stop them from reaching the royal residence of Henry IV, but after some shots have been fired whose perpetrators lost to the faceless mass, a mass hysteria ensued. They stormed the Supreme Court in Bilbao, they stormed the forts in the Pyrenees and at our borders to our Iberian brethren and they stormed the royal palace of Pamplona. The king, his wife and his children and some other notable landed nobles are nowehere to be seen, although reports are emerging that they've found refuge in Aragon and Spain. Today, in front of the university of Pamplona, the republic and therefore independence was finally declared. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV13.T;A plea for help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV13.D;The Anglois and the Navarrase have approached us. Henry IV of Navarra wants to see its kingdom freed from Aragon's iron fist no matter the cost, and proposed that Navarra becomes a client state of Spain if we're supporting their independence against Aragon's wishes. Whether this will trigger a war depends on the good will of Barcelona...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV15.T;The Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV15.D;Navarra has proclaimed its allegiance to Spain! They have expelled our representatives with the support of Spain and the Dual Monarchy of England-France. We could always intervene militarily and annex this kingdom we have coveted for centuries. But if we do so, we will have to face Spain and the Anglois Monarchy, a task which is surely beyond our capabilities!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

987415.B;It can't end this way! Declare war!;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV16.T;Aragon accepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV16.D;The Aragonese delegates seemed tired when approaching our government. "We regret the decision of the people of Euskadia, but the current political tensions between the Crown of Aragon and its neighbours do not allow for hotheaded actions against such minor losses. Be assured that your choice was the wrong one, but the king is wishing you good luck for your new journey in this brave, new world." Aragon formally accepted our plea, meaning that we have narrowly avoided a war for our cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
987416.A;Good riddance, Barcelona!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
NAV17.T;Basque Independence Fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV17.D;Our efforts were done in vain. All of our neighbors refused to help us. We have done everything we could, but it was not enough. Truly, a sad day for Navarra. Not to mention the anger of our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV18.D;Bad luck has struck Spain today. Our centuries-old former friends in Paris, the Anglo-French Dual Monarchy, have ignored our claims on the Kingdom of Navarra and influenced the ruling traitor Henry IV to such a degree that the Basque from now on are puppet of the Plantagenets. It seems like our friendship ends here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV19.D;Three Spanish military instructors have been killed in Bilbao by Basque nationalists!

NAV20.T;Spain and Navarra;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV20.D;The death of three high-ranking Spanish military officials prompted a quick and aggressive reaction from Spain. They accused the government in Pamplona and Paris to conspire against the Iberian people due to our new beginning in Euskadia and are starting to invade Navarra to "reclaim their rogue lost territory".;;;;;;;;;;;;;
987420.A;They will regret that.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
NAV21.T;Death of Henry IV of Navarra;;;;;;;;;;;;; #Should now only happen if NAV9 isn't triggered
NAV21.D;The Bourbon dynasty has seen fewer and fewer male members born these last years. The last true Bourbon, descendant of Hugh Capet has died in Pampeluna yesterday. He leaves two possible heirs : his sister, the countess of St-Sebastian married into the Aragonese royal family, and the infante of Bilbao, his illegimate daughter married to the Dauphin of England-France. The Navarran Estates have gathered to choose who will succeed to Henry and thus in which country Navarra will be closer tied with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV22.T;England-France and Navarra;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV22.D;The Navarran Estates decided to choose the unlikely candidate, wive of our dauphin, the Infante of Bilbao, as their new queen. This may very well result in a personal union between the two kingdoms, in the case that our current king passes away. Aragon is not very fond of that outcome and already issued their diplomats back to Barcelona to discuss further proceedings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A lot has changed and while Finland may now seem at peace, new ideologies and agitations stir the crestfallen and disaffected inhabitants of the region.

SCAFIN1.T;The Finnish National Awakening;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN1.D;The Finnish National Awakening is a long period of political and cultural ferment in Finland and Karelia roughly starting with the publication in 1835 of the Kalevala, a compendium of Finnic oral poetry and legends. Finnic nationalism has spread among the finnish-speaking educated middle class, starting from the foundation in 1838 of the Sampo Society in Borgå as a direct response to the Three Crowns Act. Inner Finland and Karelia have lagged behind due to their rural conformation, but the growing discontent with Scandinavian rule and fears of Russian expansionism have given rise to a distinct Karelian national sentiment of lower class origin. Despite their differences, Finnish and Karelian nationalism share the same ambitions of Finnic unity -for now- and self-rule, unlike the heavily Scandinavianized Ostrobothnian and Helsingforsian nobility, who are loyal to the idea of integral union with the mainland, despite their patronage of Finnish culture. The Finns will soon challenge Copenhagen's indifference and ask to reconsider the status of Finland within the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN2.D;Three weeks ago in Helsingfors, a public debate organized by the nationalist Sampo Society about the proposal to make Finnish a co-official language of Österland has derailed into a full fledged popular consultation regarding Scandinavian rule in the region. Despite the swift dissolution of the assembly by the police, a group of seven intellectuals has written a four page manifesto based on the proposals and the complaints gathered during the consultation. The document has been summarized in a public letter addressed to our sovereign asking to convene a National Finnish Diet to redefine Finland's status within the realm. The letter has been signed by many famous and influential intellectuals and politicians, like Count Jakob Stiernhielm, with the hope of raising awareness among Scandinavian mainlanders about Finland's problems. The Finnic nationalist front is still developing and lacks cohesion, but it's not at all certain that we could get rid of them in one go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191917.A;Stop pestering us with such grievances!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191917.B;They are still part of the Kingdom of Sweden, lest we forget. The Riksdag will decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191917.C;Summon the National Diet in Helsingfors, let them argue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN3.T;The National Diet of Helsingfors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN3.D;170 delegates from all lands belonging to the Gulf of Bothnia have been convened in the New City Hall of Helsingfors to define Finland's new constitutional order. Thus far, nationalist delegates from Karelia and Southern Finland have formed a "Autonomist" party with the support of some Ostrobothnians deputies who had signed the Petition for a National Diet. All other Ostrobothnians are staunchly opposing every attempt to remove Copenhagen's political control over the activities of the future Senate. As deputies frequently change their official stance from autonomist to conservative and viceversa there's no way to predict who will gain the upper hand. However, the next daily session will be open by our Prime Minister, who will subtly warn Karelian delegates that those who claim to be their ally against the Scandinavian "tyrant" may prove to be far harsher masters. If this manages to put a flea in their ears we might create a rift between the two nationalities. We await future developments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191918.A;It will be the pivotal moment of this Diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN4.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN4.D;Despite the Prime Minister's barefaced attempt to break the Autonomist front, Finnish and Karelian deputies preserved their political unity for several days, until the reckless suggestion of making Finnish the sole official language of the new nation shifted a sizeable group of moderate Scandinavian-speaking and Karelian deputies towards anti-independence positions. The breakaway group allowed the Ostrobothnian faction to win by a narrow margin a series of crucial votes. The definitive version of the Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Finland has been solemnly sent to our monarch by the Diet's President. The Finns will benefit from a less centralised local administration and some economical privileges, but the new Senate will have no effective scrutiny ability over the Copenhagen appointed plenipotentiary, Governor-General Carl Anders Torstensson. As the title "Grand-Duchy" suggests, there's no equal political status with the other Nordic kingdoms and foreign affairs are entirely under Scandinavian control. This will not quell the Finns' rumbling for long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191919.A;I dare them to come back asking for more after this unprecedented concession!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN5.T;Catastrophic failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN5.D;The Prime Minister's effrontery has had the opposite effect than that expected, strengthening nationalist positions and unity, thus exacerbating the clash between Scandinavian-speaking Ostrobothnians and radicalised independentists. After a fight between two deputies had interrupted a session of the Diet, the Ostrobothnian delegation decide to abandon the Chamber and return home, declaring that they will have nothing more to do with the Finns. The Rump Diet has nonetheless written a surprisingly moderate Constitution for the Kingdom of Finland. Copenhagen will retain substantial control over the Senate and the new National Diet, but the Finnish Army will be completely independent from Scandinavia's. The Helsingforsian nobility mourns the birth of a nation that publicly denounced them as traitors and awaits the time it will return under direct mainlander protection as Ostrobothnia. The Finns got what they wanted, but they won't be able to escape Scandinavian control any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191920.A;With an absolute king this would never have happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN6.T;The Karelian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN6.D;After a brilliant speech by our Prime Minister, fight has erupted between Finnish and Karelian nationalists. Divisive questions like the recognition of Karelian language have been brought to the surface, putting at risk the solidarity between Finnic nationalities. Recent votes have shown a steady growth of the Ostrobothnian-led conservative faction, but victory can not be claimed yet. The most prominent Finnish delegates are trying to mend this fracture in time for the crucial decisions on the new Senate's powers by promising autonomy and other substantial concessions. In the last few days, however, a pamphlet asking for a separate Karelian Diet has spread like wildfire in Helsingfors. Finnish and Karelian delegates call it a petty provocation, but they can't deny it well represents the feelings of some representatives of the Eastern Frontier. We can only wait until the proceedings of the Diet reach a conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191921.A;They want another Diet?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN7.T;The Autonomists reconcile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN7.D;Despite the staunch opposition of Copenhagen's most loyal supporters, the new autonomist Constitution of the Kingdom of Finland has been approved by a wide margin. After the emergence of separatist positions within the Karelian delegation many thought that the fractured Diet would be locked in a stalemate. Instead, the prompt reply of some Finnish nationalists leaders regrouped the Autonomist faction and marginalized the supporters of the "Karelian Diet Petition". The momentum gained by this display of internal cohesion permitted the approval of some radical autonomist proposals, often deleterious for the privileges of Scandinavian-speaking citizens. Copenhagen's control over the Senate and the new National Diet will be minimal. Scandinavia loses a precious piece of its Baltic dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191922.A;This is the end of an era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN8.T;The Karelian March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN8.D;The intrinsic contradictions of the Finnic nationalist movement have been exposed, leading to the dissolution of the Autonomist party. Finnish deputies have regrouped and radicalised triggering a similar reaction in the Ostrobothnian-led conservative faction. As the polarized Diet approached a stalemate, the authors of the Karelian Diet Petition made themselves public and called for a sabotage of the anti-Karelian Helsingfors Diet. As eastern deputies returned to their constituencies, the Finnish National Diet was dissolved, resulting in bare minimum changes to the status quo. However, as proposed by General Johan Von Ascheberg, Finnish nationalism can be defeated once an for all only if the South and the East stay divided. He therefore proposes the creation of a militarized "Karelian March" to defend our Eastern Frontier and quell all future separatist feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191923.A;A brilliant idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN9.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN9.D;Divergences between Finnish and Karelians nationalists have benefited the Ostrobothnian-led conservative party, leading to a rejection of many autonomist proposals. When came the pyrrhic reconciliation of the two nationalities, the most uncompromising Karelian deputies had already teamed up with the moderates, giving them a decisive majority in the Diet. The definitive version of the Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Finland was solemnly sent to the monarch by the Diet's President. The Copenhagen-appointed Governor-General Carl Anders Torstensson has almost complete control over the legislative process, with the ability to dissolve the new National Diet and nominate ministers at will. His Minister of Defence, General Johan Von Ascheberg, has transferred the control of most of the Eastern Frontier to the Scandinavian army, citing the strategic importance of the region. The Karelians, who hoped to gain a favourable arrangement at the expense of their southern cousins, are now blocked in a situation far worse than the one they started with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191924.A;This solution does not seem destined to last long...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN10.T;The Riksdag of the Estates;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN10.D;After decades of inactivity, the Riksdag of the Estates of Sweden has been convened in the House of Nobility of Stockholm to determine the new status of Österland within the Scandinavian realm. Copenhagen's Landsting has contested the legitimacy of such assembly, whose powers had been delegated de facto to the new unified chamber of the Empire, but an intervention of the Prime Minister made clear that the convocation of a kingdom's estates currently is an inappellable personal prerogative of the Monarch. As deputies from Denmark and Norway had forewarned, the opening of the Riksdag rekindled Stockholm's desire for autonomy and decentralization, transforming the Finnish Question in a challenge to Copenhagen's authority. The constitutional foundations of our nation will undergo drastic changes regardless of the decisions made by the estates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191925.A;Scandinavia will forever stand united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN11.T;The Grand Duchy of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN11.D;A speech by our monarch has officially closed the Riksdag of the Estates, putting an end to the farce of the Swedish barons. The Stockholm assembly was forced to realize its complete lack of effective political powers and the results of its workings can be considered ceremonial, at best. The Grand Duchy of Finland has been carved out of Sweden's territory and as the name suggests its status is not equal compared to the three constituent kingdoms of the Empire. The Copehagen Landsting has had its revenge, but the Riksdag's damage is done and now the Prime Minister has to appoint a Governor-General to formally deal with the powerless National Diet of Finland. The Finns have returned east feeling teased and mortified by the paternalism of the Swedes and they will surely come back asking for more autonomy. Copenhagen must now demonstrate the full capabilities of the central government, maybe by giving exceptional powers to the Governor-General in Helsingfors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191926.A;Carl Anders Torstensson will be our trusted man in Finland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN12.T;The Instrument of Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN12.D;Long negotiations with the representatives of the Finnish Estates have lead to the adoption of a new Instrument of Government for the Kingdom of Sweden, officially changing its name to the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Finland. Stockholm celebrated what was widely regarded as the creation of a Swedish Empire within Scandinavia, but the first Finnish-speaking delegates at the Landsting in Copenhagen were vocal in denouncing the paternalism of the Swedes and the absence of true political reform. They officially appealed to the Chamber representing the Empire as a whole asking to grant to all Finns effective citizenship rights and protection, within and outside the borders of the Kingdom. This is the perfect opportunity to reaffirm Copenhagen's authority: we must seize the Finnic lands just across our border and prove once more that our country is strong and united. But if we pursue in our inaction, it won't be just the Eastern Frontier that will search for alternative solutions to our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191927.A;We must safeguard Finland and Karelia from the Eastern menace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN13.T;The Helsingfors Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN13.D;As foretold by months of growing unrest, fighting has erupted in the streets of Helsingfors after a peaceful demonstration of the Sampo Society was dispersed by the police. The popular neighbourhoods are completely out of control and the chief of the city police has been shot while supervising an assault to a barricade. The representative of the Scandinavian government has left the city in secret and is now trying to organize a retaliation from the Sveaborg Fortress, in the nearby archipelago. As the news reached the rest of the country, other Finnish cities have followed Helsingfors' fate and some border garrisons manned by Finnish and Karelian recruits have mutinied. Copenhagen promised equity and protection to its Finnic subjects, but its despotic rule over the region and the complete indifference for the cries of help coming from across the border have depleted the Finnish patience and trust. Nationalism reaches its natural outcome: a Finnish War of Independence is now inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191928.A;We will strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN14.T;The Pacification of the Eastern Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN14.D;With the expulsion of the Slavic invaders, Karelia is united once and for all under the aegis of Scandinavia. Copenhagen has fulfilled its promise to the Finnic nation and now the Landsting can rightfully claim to be the only representative body of all the Nordic peoples. Finnish nationalism will not bother Scandinavia for a long long time, but it will not disappear completely. The hard-earned harmony must be secured from the ambitions of its enemies in the East and in the South, by all means necessary. As our Empire is more united now than it has ever been, we must use this new-found strength to impose our peace on the entire Baltic basin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191929.A;A tough chapter ends and a glorious one begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN15.T;The Great Petition;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN15.D;After their underwhelming first attempt, the Sampo Society has organized an unprecedented collection of signatures throughout Finland and Karelia with the volunteer help of university students. The meticulous organization of the campaign has resulted in the collection in less than two weeks of over three hundred thousand nominatives, which have been delivered to the Royal Palace in Copenhagen by a delegation of the Society, lead by Count Jakob Stiernhielm and the self-exiled Prince of Friesland, Charles-Joseph de Frise. The recent years of mismanagement of the region have compacted the nationalist front, which has put aside regionalist interferences in favour of pan-Finnic unity, so it might not be possible to hush again separatist sentiments. Were the petition be rejected, the agitators will have their perfect chance to proclaim that Copenhagen does not care for its subjects across the Gulf of Bothnia and this may lead to open rebellion. It seems like we have no choice but to assent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191930.A;This petition is wasted paper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191930.B;Maybe this way we can avoid a useless war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN16.T;The National Diet of Åbo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN16.D;The Estates of Finland have convened in the main building of the former Royal Academy of Åbo, known as Turku in Finnish, to define once and for all Finland's status within the Scandinavian Realm. The hemicycle is almost perfectly split in half between the self styled "Fennoscandian Party", favourable to the draft articles proposed by the Copenhagen Landsting, and the autonomist deputies, who have adopted the appellation of "Kalevalists", satirically used by a Stockholmer newspaper. The president of the National Diet, Duke Erik Mannerheim, has painstakingly maintained the balance between the two groups, but as the debate advances, Fennoscandians and Kalevalists espouse increasingly divergent and irreconcilable stances. The Finns face the final choice between full citizenship and protection within Scandinavia, as promised by Copenhagen, or the gamble of self-determination. The Nordic Union is hung by a thread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191931.A;We shall wait for the result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN17.T;The National Pledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN17.D;Thanks to the acclaimed diplomatic skills of Duke Erik Mannerheim, the moderate Kelavalist deputies have found a reasonable agreement with the Fennoscandian Party. The new constitution includes many of the draft articles proposed by Copenhagen and some important additions put forward by the nationalists. The newborn Kingdom of Finland will be a constituent country of the Scandinavian Empire and just like Denmark, Sweden and Norway, it will formally retain its national assembly (the Eduskunta) while delegating most of the legislative power to the Empire's Landsting in the capitol. After the solemn National Pledge to the Monarch in the Åbo Cathedral, Count Jakob Stiernhielm delivered a speech asking for the extension of full citizenship rights and protection to the Karelian brethren living across the border, where Slavic expansionism threatens their very existence. By unifying Karelia, Copenhagen may finally prove their good faith and curb Finnish nationalism once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191932.A;Itään!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN18.T;Catastrophic failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN18.D;Despite the best efforts of the deputies loyal to the Empire, a new constitution has been drafted by the Kalevalists with the support of some Fennoscandian defectors. A bold harangue by deputy Charles-Joseph de Frise against the draft articles proposed by the Landsting turned the tide of the National Diet in favour of the nationalists, facilitating the following crucial Kelavalist victories. The new National Assembly (the Eduskunta) and Senate will de facto be completely free from Copenhagen's interference and even if the Scandinavian Monarch will still rule over the newborn Kingdom of Finland, the Governor-General will be merely ceremonial figure. In the mainland, disappointment is widespread among the entire population and the general opinion is that the government has officially abandoned the historical ambition of uniting the Baltic under the Scandinavian banner. As Finland secedes without firing a shot, many are becoming critical of the old and weary Kalmar Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191933.A;Is the end of the Scandinavian Empire drawing nearer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN19.T;The Diet is dissolved;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN19.D;An attempted arson of the building where the National Diet meets has forced the Prime Minister to halt the assembly indefinitely. In the days preceding the attack, the tense relationship between Fennoscandians and Kalevalists had reached a breaking point, forcing the Diet's president to close the session in multiple occasions due to fights between deputies. A Finnish-language radical newspaper (Aamurusko) claims that the arsonist attack has been orchestrated by the Scandinavian government to impede the rejection of Copenhagen's draft articles in the forthcoming session of the Diet and reinstate the status quo by dissolving the assembly. Despite the lack of evidence, many former Finnic deputies have publicly repudiated the Åbo parliament and have started to organize an autonomous Parliament in Borgå. Unrest is quickly growing in the Finnish countryside and some cities like Tavastehus are already in open rebellion. War seems imminent. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191934.A;This is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN20.T;The Pink Declaration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN20.D;To contain the escalating violence spreading throughout Finland after the attempted arsonist attack at the National Diet, a large group of former deputies and intellectuals have gathered in Tammersfors to complete as fast as possible the drafting of Finland's constitution. The resulting compromise between the Fennoscandians and moderate Kelavalists has been printed on pink-coloured paper and has started to spread throughout the country, gaining mixed reactions. The proposed arrangement will give Finland a great deal of autonomy, nonetheless substantial control over the Parliament and the Senate will be in the hands of the Governor-General and Copenhagen's Landsting. By recognizing the Pink Declaration, most of the Finnic political and cultural elite will reconcile with Scandinavia, but the anger caused by the Åbo Incident will continue to spread albeit at a weaker pace. War has been avoided at a great cost, but it seems like the ghost of violence will not leave Finland for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191935.A;Troubled times lay ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN21.T;The Eduskunta in Borgå;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN21.D;Fostered by the Sampo Society and the nationalist gazette Aamurusko, the leading figures of Finland's political and cultural panorama have gathered in the city of Borgå to draft a constitution for the Kingdom of Finland in complete autonomy from the Landsting and the Crown. As the city celebrates the gathering of deputies from all over the country, a growing number of formerly moderate political figures have openly challenged the dogma of a real union with the Empire of the Scandinavia, petitioning for the creation of a Kingdom of Finland with a king other than that of Copenhagen. All orders to halt this insubordination have gone unheeded and following cascading mutinies most of the Imperial Army warehouses have been looted, limiting Scandinavia's effective rule over the region to some major coastal forts like Sveaborg in the Helsingfors bay. The creation of "National Defence Battalions" demonstrates the intentions of the Finnish deputies: only brute force can end this madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191936.A;Finland will know the Mainland's wrath!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN22.T;The Finnish Declaration of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN22.D;The birth of Kingdom of Finland has been proclaimed from the balcony of the new Senate building in Helsingfors in front of a packed Central Square. The provisional legislative assembly, the Eduskunta, has nominated a plenipotentiary cabinet, the Senate, which will also have the role of a regency council. Independentist zeal spreads throughout the newborn nation and volunteers flock to the recruitment office for the National Defense Batallions. Copenhagen's control over the region has been reduced to a mere formality and a large influx of Scandinavian-speaking refugees has reached the shores of Sweden, fleeing the incoming persecutions of the nationalist government. The imperial cabinet has tried for the last time to reach a peaceful compromise with the Finnish Senate, but a vote of the Eduskunta against the recognition of the Scandinavian Monarch as the head of state has abruptly ended all negotiations. The Finland Uprising has been set in motion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191937.A;Österland will pay for this treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN23.T;The King of Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN23.D;Finland has broken the chains of oppression and now needs a King to rally behind. Most of the Scandinavian-speaking deputies of the Eduskunta support the crowning of Count Jakob Stiernhielm, a descendent of an illegitimate son of King Alexander IV. This conciliatory figure will mend the rift between our Scandinavian and Finnish citizens, but Jakob's conservative nature will most likely letdown and alienate the zealous nationalists that are fueling Finland's morale and war effort. To gain foreign help, many have suggested petitioning Prague for a noble to crown in exchange of mutual support against Scandinavia, but the most popular foreign candidate is the Prince of Friesland, Charles-Joseph de Frise, the self-exiled liberal son of Queen Anne of Burgundy who has become a member of the new Senate. He's the nationalists' choice, but will the Burgundians accept the crowning of this rogue family member and the final conclusion of their long worn off alliance with Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.A;Will Anvers recognize Charles Joseph?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.B;Send a messenger to Prague!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191938.C;Count Jakob Stiernhielm becomes King Jaakko I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN24.T;A crown from the gutter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN24.D;Finland has declared independence from Scandinavia and the provisional Regency Council has decided to ask us for a suitable monarch in exchange of a military alliance and substantial economic concessions. This is the perfect occasion to further weaken Scandinavia's grip of the Baltic Sea. Bedrich z Valdstejna, the most prominent member of one the most influential families of the nation, has proven his political skills as governor of Moravia and his family's close links with Bohemian royalty certainly give him the blue blood necessary to bear the crown. Shall the country prepare for yet another war in the North?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191939.A;We will stand with the Finns!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191939.B;The proposal is rejected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN25.T;A King from Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN25.D;Frederick von Waldstein has landed in Helsinki in great secret to ensure his safe voyage. After a unanimous approval by the Eduskunta, King Fredrik I has been crowned in the Helsinki Cathedral and has confirmed the special powers delegated to the Senate in the previous days. No one dares to interrupt the celebrations, but many in private whisper that the foreign king is more suitable for palace intrigues than for motivating soldiers before a desperate war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191940.A;We'll just have to make do for this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN26.T;The unexpected king;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN26.D;Prague has completely ignored the Senate's request for military support in exchange for political and economical influence over Finland. The secret negotiations have been rapidly covered up, but the Eduskunta awaits a new head of state before Scandinavia recovers from the shock of the secession and strikes down hard over the country. Count Jakob Stiernhielm has refused to accept the crown after he had learned of the attempt to contact the Bohemians, whom he had fought against in the past. The Prince of Friesland has disappeared from Helsinki and many suspect that he would not accept the "Second-Hand" crown, angering his nationalist political base. During the last extraordinary session of the Senate, however, the choice fell on the only political figure in the Eduskunta with unanimous respect and admiration from both the conservatives and the radical nationalists: Duke Erik Mannerheim. Despite his lack of dynastic ties with royal families, the love of his people will ennoble him enough to become a rightful king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191941.A;Long live King Erkki I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN27.T;The Prince of Friesland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN27.D;Charles-Joseph de Frise, the second son of Queen Anne, has been proposed as the monarch of the newly independent Kingdom of Finland. Charles Joseph has been a frequent embarrassment for the Burgundian royal family due to his unorthodox political ideas, but his voluntary self-exile to the far North had appeased the court of Anvers. Officially recognizing his investiture will give us substantial political and economical benefits in the new realm, but this alliance with the Finns would force us to leave behind our increasingly problematic political alignment with Copenhagen. Disavowing Charles Joseph comes at no cost beyond the potential risk of a regency should Queen Anne depart with no further heirs, but the potential gains deriving from a change of policy towards Scandinavia are conceivably superior to those coming from renewing our weary alliance with the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191942.A;Let us help our new Finnish friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191942.B;He has nothing to do with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN28.T;The King of all Finns;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN28.D;The Prince of Friesland has been enthusiastically acclaimed as the new monarch by the Eduskunta and the Senate. Charles-Joseph de Frise has decided to relinquish his Burgundian name and title, becoming Kaarle I of Jülich-Kleve-Suomi, King of all Finns. This energetic and charismatic figure enjoys the support of most of the common people and radical nationalists, but many conservative and moderate figures do not hide their fears of his authoritarian tendencies. Time will tell if King Kaarle will respect the directions of his former peers in the Senate and the legislative assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191943.A;God save our glorious King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN29.T;Citizen and Deputy Charles Joseph;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN29.D;When informed of the Senate's decision to crown Charles-Joseph de Frise as King of Finland , Anvers replied by disavowing him and condemning the Finnish uprising. While many support the coronation of the "Citizen-King" regardless of Burgundy's hostility, a group of radical nationalists have suggested to remove all traces of the Scandinavian monarchic mentality and name Charles Joseph "President for life of Finland". However, many adversaries of the ambitious Prince of Friesland, including moderates and former loyalists, have voiced their opposition to these eccentric and blatantly autocratic denominations, proposing instead the creation of a republican parliamentary regime, whose head of state will be decided every six years by the national assembly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.A;Long live King Kaarle I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.B;Finland shall be a free, united and democratic Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191944.C;All hail our perpetual President!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN30.T;The Finnish Independence War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN30.D;After centuries of Scandinavian domination, Finland has declared its independence and is now fighting to repel its former oppressors. Ever since their conversion to Christianity, Finnish and Karelians have lived under the influence of either Novgorod or Stockholm and later Copenhagen, fighting against each other to conquer every possible inch of the "Eastern Frontier" for their overlords. The publishing in 1835 of the Kalevala, an epic poem based on Finnic oral folklore, triggered the Finnish National Awakening, rallying intellectuals, artists and, later, politicians from both sides of the Scandinavian-Novgorodian border under the common goal of uniting the Finnic people and protecting it from assimilation either from the West or the East. The members of this movement initially hoped to achieve their goals by peacefully petitioning Copenhagen to recognize their rights to citizenship and national unity within the Scandinavian realm, but the indifference and the missteps of the central government caused the radicalization of Finnish nationalism, leading to the current violent secession. Will the Empire of the North live through this new challenge?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191945.A;We shall strike them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN31.T;The War in Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN31.D;With the start of the Finnish Rebellion, Scandinavia has been too busy organizing the reconquest of its former Baltic dominion to interfere in the internal affairs of our country. The Veche is now free to reclaim its former political authority by revoking the illegal privileges of Scandinavian bourgeoisies. The election of the Posadnik will no longer be determined by the whims of Copenhagen. We are finally free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191946.A;Wonderful news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN32.T;The Treaty of Uppsala;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN32.D;A peace treaty between Scandinavia and Finland has been signed in the ancient capitol of the Swedish Kingdom, of which the newborn nation will no longer be part. The unforeseen defeat has been a tremendous blow for the Empire of the North, whose hegemony in the Baltic Sea is now a thing of the past. After centuries of relative internal peace, regional separatist movements have started to reclaim autonomy from weak Copenhagen for the constituent kingdoms of the realm, especially Sweden whose territory has been halved. To survive this dire moment, Scandinavia has to prove once more its might and its importance among the European empires, and when this time comes the East will face our vengeance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191947.A;A minor setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN33.T;The Last Northern Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN33.D;As soon as the fighting reached the outskirts of Helsingfors, the provisional government of Finland realized that the war was lost and that the exhausted National Defense Batallions could not withstand the assault of the Scandinavian army. Most of the members of the Eduskunta have either surrendered to the imperial forces or have fled towards Russia or Germany, where the enemies of the Empire have promised to support the future struggles for independence of the Finnic people. The resurgence of Finnic nationalism will probably be slow to arrive as war has ravaged both the countryside and the urban centres, leaving behind a war torn and disfigured country. Österland will be reorganized in ten military governances and the estates expropriated from the supporters of the revolutionary regime will be gifted to loyal Scandinavian-speaking subjects of the Empire. The effects of the Finnish National Awakening will be reversed with a process of pervasive Scandinavization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN34.T;The Pskov Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN34.D;Bourgeoises, merchants and nobles from both the city and the countryside are reunited every three years in the Pskovian Veche to appoint a new Posadnik, who has always been a Scandinavian Noble since the rebirth of the Republic. Copenhagen enforces its will either through direct interference in the election process or thanks to its fifth column: the Finnish boyars, who are disproportionately numerous in the Veche thanks to Byzantine bureaucracy and special constitutional clauses. An angry mob has killed the newly re-appointed Posadnik, Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, by setting fire to the wooden stage where he was delivering his inaugural speech. Some members of the Veche have died and peasants are besieging the City Hall, but an extraordinary session has been summoned nonetheless to nominate a new Posadnik. Copenhagen is too distant to intervene quickly and Finnish boyars are in disarray. For the first time since "independence", Pskov will decide its own ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SCAFIN35.D;The Pskovians have rescinded with violent means the privileges of Finnish boyars and in a surprising turn of events the Veche has voted to recognize as sovereign the Prince of Novgorod, rejoining the Novgorodian Confederation. Uniting the Northern Russians will surely anger Copenhagen, but most of the members of the Novgorodian Veche have already proclaimed their support for this development, regardless of the unavoidable retaliation and the end of Scandinavia's protection against Muscovite expansionism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191950.A;Novgorod the Great will return to the Baltic shore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN36.T;Pskov Rejoins Novogrod;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN36.D;After the Pskovian peasants killed Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, the Scandinavian-appointed Posadnik of the Republic, a group of Russian boyars took control of the city's Veche and swore fealty to the Prince of Novgorod. Despite the extensive Scandinavian interests in the republic, Pskov is intent on rejoining the Novgorodian Confederation. Given how the unrest in Finland and the ever-present threat of Bohemia have already stretched our forces thin, it might be wiser to attempt to come to a compromise with the Novgorodians, partitioning the lands of Pskov between each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191951.A;Offer them the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191951.B;Never! We will teach these upstarts not to defy Copenhagen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN37.T;The Partition of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN37.D;The Scandinavian reaction to what was effectively a pro-Novgorodian coup has been much milder than anticipated. Copenhagen has offered us a deal in which they agree to recognize our annexation of Pskov as legitimate in exchange for control over Ingria. While a relatively favorable deal, with the bulk of Pskov remaining in our hands, it still fails to resolve the question of our access to the Baltic. There are those in the Veche who loudly proclaim this offer a sign of Scandinavian weakness, and that we should demand the retention of Ingria, even in the event of war. Still others hold that we ought to be satisfied with our laurels, cautioning that Scandinavian protection is the only thing shielding us from aggression by our southern neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191952.A;Copenhagen shall have Ingria, lest we find ourselves surrounded on all sides by enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191952.B;We knew the risks. Pskov will be ours, by force of arms if necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN38.T;The Novgorodian Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN38.D;The Novgorodians have rejected our generous offer to partition the former Republic of Pskov. Already, Novgorodian armies have begun to mobilize and march towards Finland and our Livonian holdings. For the audacity to reject our treaty the Novgorodians will know the full wrath of Scandinavia as we lay waste to their precious republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191953.A;Spare the rod, spoil the child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN39.T;The Posadnik of the Republic of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN39.D;The Scandinavian-appointed governor of Pskov, Bengt Eriksson Mannerskd, has been killed by a riot soon after his re-election. The sudden loss of foreign influence over the Pskovian Veche allowed the Russian boyars to independently choose the city's Posadnik, opting for a compromise figure: Adam Grundel-Helmfelt, the Duke of Narva. Adam is a Stockholm-born entrepreneur and Ingria's richest landowner, who has gained the admiration of Russian boyars with calls for fair representation and administrative reform. After his proclamation as Posadnik, Adam "Nerevsky" (from Narva, a sobriquet on "Nevskij" coined by Finnish colonists) has promulgated a new constitution, abolishing most political privileges of the Finnic minority. De facto this doesn't change much in our protectorate, as almost all the political power is in his hands, but tolerating Pskov's self-rule and pro-Slavic legislation may slowly slip the Republic away from our control. How shall we react? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191954.A;We shall accept the status quo ... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191954.B;Perhaps we need to make it clear to this upstart who rules in Pskov?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN40.T;The Ingermanland March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN40.D;The whole of Ingria has finally come under direct Scandinavian rule. An autonomous dependency has been set up to administer the territory with the eventual goal of integrating the province directly into the Scandinavian state. After a brief spat with the Novgorodians, mare nostrum Balticum has been reaffirmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191955.A;No longer shall Finland and Livonia be threatened from the east!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN41.T;Pskov Rejoins the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN41.D;After reaching an agreement with the Scandinavians, Pskov has been allowed to rejoin the Novgorodian Confederation as a constituent republic. While the Scandinavians still hold hostage our access to the Baltic, today is nonetheless a victory for Novgorod the Great. Cries of jubilation can be heard all throughout the republic as our brothers have been reunited with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191956.A;Perhaps one day we may also regain the Baltic coastline ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN42.T;The expulsion of the Pomors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN42.D;Scandinavia has extended citizenship rights and protection to all Finnic people, regardless of the country of origin, leading to the overnight annexation of our Karelian territories and the expulsion of our Pomor compatriots who had settled in the region. This blatant violation of the long-standing border treaty with the Empire of the North has caused great outrage in the Novgorodian Veche and most of the city's notables are petitioning for vengeance against foreign invaders and the expulsion of Finnic and Scandinavian nationals from the Republic. Bowing to Copenhagen's will means tainting the secular pride of Novgorodian independence, but denouncing the aggression will remove the political and military protection that lets this pride live on despite threats from the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191957.A;It's a terrible price to pay if we want to safeguard our Republic's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
191957.B;We shall redraw the western border with our swords and their blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.T;The Pskov Problem;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.D;Pan-Russianism has experienced a resurgence in the Republic of Pskov in the wake of the creation of a Russian nation-state. The Russian-majority population of the Republic widely supports the prospect of annexation by Russia but the Finnish boyars who dominate the government enjoy the privileges independence affords them. Recently, however, we have been approached by a group of pro-Russian patriots that promises to seize control of the Veche and proclaim annexation to Russia. They claim that the Pskovian army, composed primarily of Russians, considers Russian annexation favorable -- or at the very least not unfavorable -- and that they would not act to prevent the uprising. Such a move would certainly be more diplomatically palatable than a military invasion of the Republic, though we must still be wary of the Scandinavian response to our actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN43.A;Pskov must join the Russian fold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.T;The End of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.D;Their work was swift. In the dead of the long Russian night, pan-Russian insurgents had stormed the Veche and seized control over the Republic. The Pskovian army was powerless to stop them, with Russian officers unwilling to fire upon their fellow countrymen and many even rallying to the cause of the rebels. Already, these insurgents have proclaimed the Republic annexed to Russia, and the Russian army has swooped in to take over control from these rebels -- not, however, before the Scandinavian army could seize the fortress at Nyenschanz. The situation remains tense, but one thing remains certain: the Republic of Pskov is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN44.A;A sad day for the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.T;The Stain on Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.D;For some time now the Republic of Pskov has been no more. At one time, the Scandinavians had set up a military administration in its place, but now what was once a Scandinavian governorate has become an independent nation. The basic structure administering the territory has not changed, however, with the predominantly Finnish-Scandinavian ruling class marginalizing the Russian-majority population of the territory. This situation is a stain on the honor of the Russian nation, and nationalists both at home and abroad have called for our government to intervene on the behalf of our oppressed countrymen. Our agents have been covertly organizing the Russian population of Ingria with the promise of Russian support for their revolt, and now the time has come to make good on this pledge. We must wipe this stain off of the maps of Europe and complete the unification of the Russian nation!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN45.A;We must drive out these Scandinavian freebooters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.T;The Collapse of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.D;Our fledgling administration was always one built on an unstable foundation. Originating as a march of Scandinavia, our nation since its inception has been ruled by force of arms, and not with the consent of the masses. Since our independence from Scandinavia, our ability to provide for our armies has suffered greatly, and with nationalist tensions mounting with the recent unification of Russia it should come as no surprise that our meagre forces have been quickly overrun by a country-wide nationalist revolt. The whole of Ingermanland has been seized by these rebels and transferred to Russian control, barring the fortress at Nyenschanz, which has been hastily occupied by our evacuating forces. What still exists of our army has defected back to our former Scandinavian overlords, ensuring that in both fact and name Ingermanland no longer exists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN46.A;It was only a matter of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.T;The Problem of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.D;The question of Pskov remains a point of major contention between the newly-formed Russian nation and Scandinavia. While nominally independent, the Republic of Pskov has effectively been little more than a Scandinavian client state in the region for the past few decades, denying us access to the Baltic. Chafing under Scandinavian suzerainty, and inspired by our recent national unification, the Russian-majority population has instigated a popular uprising, seizing control of the Veche and proclaiming the lands of the republic an indivisible part of our new nation. While the revolt was ultimately put down via Scandinavian intervention, the magnitude of the revolt has turned the opinions of the great powers of Europe largely against Scandinavian rule. With Russia now united under our rule, and Scandinavia diplomatically isolated on this issue, we have seen fit to press the claims of these nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN47.A;Pskov will be liberated from the Scandinavian tyrants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.T;The Treaty of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.D;The question of Pskov remains a point of major contention between the newly-formed Russian nation and Scandinavia. While nominally independent, the Republic of Pskov has effectively been little more than a Scandinavian client state in the region for the past few decades, denying the Russians access to the Baltic. Chafing under our suzerainty, and inspired by the recent unification of the Russian princes, the Russian-majority population has instigated a popular uprising, seizing control of the Veche and proclaiming the lands of the republic an indivisible part of the newly-formed Russian nation. While we succeeded in restoring power to the surviving members of the Veche, the Russians have decided to press the claims of these rebels, and after witnessing the scope of the uprising the rest of the great powers of Europe generally agree that we should make some concessions to the Russians living in the territory./n /n Having succeeded in isolating us, our only diplomatic recourse now is to reach a settlement favorable to the Russians that at least ensures our security in Finland and Livonia. Should the Russians reject our offer there can be no doubt that they will take this opportunity to seize Pskov for themselves. There are some who believe that war may be a good thing, however. If we were to triumph over the Russians on the field of battle, they would be forced to recognize our control over Pskov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.A;The Russians may have Pskov, but we will retain Nyenschanz as a matter of national security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN48.B;Never! The Gate of Russia is ours alone to open and close at will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.T;An Offer from Copenhagen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.D;Having been forced to the negotiating table, Copenhagen has approached us with a highly favorable treaty in which the majority of Pskov will be immediately annexed to us. Scandinavia will maintain control only over their fortress at Nyenschanz and only for a period of 15 years as they prepare adequate defenses elsewhere in Finland, after which point they promise to hand the territory over to us. Of course, the Scandinavians may always renege on that promise, but perhaps that is a risk worth taking. If our interests in the north are not that great, a friendly neighbor in Scandinavia will certainly prove a valuable asset as we direct our attention in other directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.A;This is everything we could have hoped for! We will accept their treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN49.B;We cannot tolerate Scandinavian control over the mouth of the Neva for even one more minute! Nyenschanz shall be ours immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.T;The End of Pskov;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.D;Once again the great powers of Europe have convened to decide the fate of an independent nation and once again that nation was not party to their negotiations. While the Scandinavians supported us in putting down that nationalist revolt they have now backstabbed us at the negotiation table. Russia and Scandinavia have mutually agreed to partition our nation, with the Republic of Pskov henceforth being no more in the eyes of the world. The Pskovian Veche has with great sorrow assembled for one last time to pass a measure confirming the dissolution of the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN50.A;Perhaps someday an international organization may exist to protest these infringements on national sovereignty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.T;The Ingrian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.D;The Scandinavians thought that they could placate us with empty promises and half-hearted efforts at reconciliation. But no! We reject any offer from Copenhagen short of the complete unification of the Russian nation, and to that end we have declared a state of war with Scandinavia. Pskov has declared itself an indivisible part of the Russian nation and we intend on making good on that fact. Scandinavia shall not deny us our heritage, and they shall not throttle our access to the Baltic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN51.A;We shall teach them the might of a united Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.T;Humiliation from the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.D;Our forces have been soundly defeated by the armies of Russia! As part of the peace agreement, we have been forced to recognize as valid the declaration from those upstart nationalists. The whole of Pskov shall be immediately annexed to Russia without partition. In return, the Russians have withdrawn their occupation forces from Finland and Livonia, restoring our control over the regions. With the loss of Ingria, our holdings in Finland and Livonia are no longer connected by land, and the loss of the fortress at Nyenschanz has left both Finland and Livonia undefended from the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN52.A;Well, at least we still have Finland ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.T;The Ingermanland March;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.D;The peasant hordes of Russia proved to be no match for the professional armies of Scandinavia! The Russian bear lies before us, defeated and discredited, leaving us free to act as we please with respect to Ingria. Having recognized how the nominally independent Republic of Pskov failed to defend our interests against the mounting nationalist pressures of the population, we have seen fit to dissolve the republic and replace it with a military commission to govern the region directly under the control of Copenhagen. The Ingermanland March, as it is known, will pave the way for Scandinavian and Finnish settlement in the region, ensuring the future loyalty of the territory and the smooth transition to eventual Scandinavian integration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN53.A;Pskov has served its purpose. Now Copenhagen has taken control of the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.T;The Ingrian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.D;For some time now the Republic of Pskov has been no more, and in its place we have set up a military administration over its former territories. The measures that the Ingermanland March has taken to ensure the loyalty of the territories have been admittedly harsh, with the forcible relocation of large parts of the Russian population being commonplace, amongst other practices. Recent publications of accounts of our rule, while clearly heavily embellished, have nonetheless caused outrage throughout Russia and the rest of Europe, creating a crisis over the region. How this ultimately plays out remains to be seen, but for now we have taken direct control over the affected regions from the Ingermanland March as a temporary measure in order to quell the immediate concerns over our marchs governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN54.A;Oops ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.T;The Ingrian Oppression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.D;Accounts of Scandinavian atrocities in Ingria have circulated for a while now, but for the first time we now have definitive proof of their conduct in the territory. Papers containing orders to seize the lands of Russian landowners, and forged documents detailing the transfer of property from said landowners to Scandinavian and Finnish settlers have been intercepted. Mass graves of Russian peasants have been uncovered and photographed, as have the deserted villages from which they originated. Newspapers all across Europe are now publishing accounts of these atrocities, inflaming public opinion against the Scandinavian occupation. At this point, we could either send an ultimatum to the Scandinavians, demanding reparations for their violence and the transfer of those lands inhabited by a Russian majority, or we could forgo asking entirely and simply seize the entirety of the Ingermanland March. Either way, our cause is just, and the great powers of Europe are unlikely to intervene against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.A;These barbarians are not fit to govern Russians! Demand the land and reparations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN55.B;We must seize the whole of Ingria and punish them for these deplorable acts of violence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.T;The Russian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.D;The Russians have sent us an ultimatum. In it, they demand that we cede to them those territories in Ingria inhabited by a Russian-majority population. They have also demanded financial reparations on behalf of the victims, both real and imagined, of our rule over the region. Do we give in to their demands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.A;The Russians have isolated us. We have no other choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN56.B;A hundred thousand men will lie dead before we cede an inch of soil to the Russians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.T;A Baltic Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.D;While we do not necessarily lack a Baltic coastline, that short stretch we do control is unsuitable for the construction of any sort of harbor. As a result, most of our northern trade continues to flow to the rest of Europe via the Neva, allowing the Scandinavians to maintain a stranglehold on our trade with their control of Nyenschanz. With the rise of a unified Russian economy and the growing economic prosperity it has brought us, the situation has reached a point where it has become necessary to gain free access to the markets of Europe, whether that be by direct control over the Neva estuary or some other agreement with the Scandinavians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN57.A;Perhaps the Scandinavians can accommodate us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.T;The Conference of Helsinki;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.D;While the Conference of Helsinki quickly concluded that the Scandinavian straits should be free and open to international traffic, the original issue that prompted negotiations in the first place -- that of Scandinavian Ingria -- remained unresolved. The proposal that seemed to have the most traction was to partition the Ingermanland March, with Scandinavia retaining the fortress at Nyenschanz in order to defend Finland while Russia gains a length of coastline suitable for the construction of a new port. Russia would also be exempt from paying the large indemnity we receive for abolishing the toll. Another proposal, albeit less popular, was to cede the entirety of Ingria to the Russians in exchange for their recognition of our sovereignty over Karelia. Still others are frustrated with these negotiations in the first place, having become upset that the issue has resulted in the loss of the Sound Toll, and maintain that we ought at least retain the whole of Ingria for having lost this major source of state revenue. (ONLY REJECTION IS POSSIBLE IN CURRENT BUILD);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN58.A;We have already lost our right to the Sound Toll. Ingria is where we draw the line!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.T;The Ingrian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.D;Negotiations have broken down between us and the Scandinavians. They insist on maintaining their stranglehold on our access to the Baltic, which to us is unacceptable. We will make Scandinavia pay for their crimes against the Russian nation as we seize the whole of Ingria from them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN59.A;They shall soon know to fear the Russian bear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.T;The Loss of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.D;Vae Victis! Woe to the defeated! With our forces crushed by the armies of Russia, we are forced to recognize the Russian annexation of Ingria and the loss of our claims to the territory. In return, the Russians have agreed to withdraw from Finland and Livonia, though who knows how long until the Russians come back to seize those as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN60.A;We have been humiliated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN61.T;The Humiliation of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SCAFIN61.D;Victory! Our armies stand victorious over the battered Russian bear! As part of the treaty creating peace between our two nations, the Russians have been forced to pay a large indemnity for damages caused by their armies to the property of Scandinavian citizens. The Russians have also been forced to recognize our control over Ingria in perpetuity. How long perpetuity is in actuality remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the humiliation Russia has experienced at our hands will forbid them from Ingria for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARI2.D;Following the proclamation of the Empire of Italy the city of Rome has been preparing for the imperial coronation of Joseph. After a triomphal parade throughout the old city, the emperor and his family ended in the basilica of Saint Peter where the Pope would perform the coronation. However, despite his promises to the Pope, Joseph crowned himself, instead of letting the Pope give him the crown, leaving the Holy Father angered and bitter at the ceremony. Nevertheless this ceremony was recalled as magnificent, with amabassadors from all over Europe and beyond noticing the power of the new state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ARI3.D;Following the proclamation of the Empire of Italy the city of Rome has been preparing for the imperial coronation of Ferdinando. After a triomphal parade throughout the old city, Ferdinando made a great speech at the ruins of the Coliseum about his late father who paved the way for the success of the crown of Aragon. The emperor and his family ended their tour of the city in the basilica of Saint Peter where the Pope would perform the coronation. However, despite his promises to the Pope, Ferdinando crowned himself, instead of letting the Pope give him the crown, leaving the Holy Father angered and bitter at the ceremony.

ARI4.T;Troubles in the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI4.D;None thought that proclaiming the Empire would solve all problems in the Western Mediterranean but the young empire faces several oppositions that could spell the end of the Serna dream. First the Pope, angered by the Imperial coronation and the reduction of his temporal powers, is proving to be hard to manage, especially as the devout hordes of catholics in the South and the rest of the Empire look up to him. The northern princes of Italy have not stayed idle either, with Marianists gathering support against what they consider our illegitimate rule. And Catalonia, once the center of the Crown, has seen various liberal and nationalist agitators advocating for an independent and republican Catalonia. We must be careful not to upset these groups if we don't want to see the end of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARI4.A;We will prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC1.T;The Rzeczpospolita;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
PLC1.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has been in decline since the XVIIth century. The crown of Poland and Lithania was forced to give several concessions to the nobility over the centuries making the elected King nothing more than a glorified puppet in the hands of the Magnates holding huge domains where serfdom still prevails. The Union between the crown of Poland and its Ruthenian and Lithuanian territories has weakened as the Hetmans and foreign powers influence the governors of these areas. Poland is not vulnerable to Revolution thanks to a relatively Liberal political situation but if the Magnates aren't kept in check it's hard to see what will happen to Poland ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC2.D;The king of the Commonwealth has died in Warsaw after 20 years of rule mostly marked by his inability to hold any power in his Kingdom. All Sejms convened by Maximilian III were defeated by the use of liberum veto (the right for any noble to oppose proposals of the Assembly) and the pervading influence of Scandinavia and Bohemia. Despite his political weakness he leaves a good memory to the citizens of Warsaw that have gathered in huge crowds for his funeral. Now the prepatory Sejm will convene to select candidates to his succession, with his son Stanislaw in good place to succeed him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC2.A;Farewell Maksymilian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.T;The Sejm in deadlock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC3.D;The Sejm has been convened for already several months and has not been able to advance a definitive list of candidates to the succession of Maximilian III. The main problem resides in the candidacy of his son Stanislaw, a well-known Liberal and independent noble which is seen as a threat by both the foreign powers of Scandinavia and Bohemia but also by the most powerful nobles of the country who fear he will try to rescind their privileges. The liberation of his serfs in his own domain in 1833 was already widely criticized by the Magnateria while giving Stanislaw widespread popularity outside of the nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC4.T;The Black procession;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC4.D;Following the deadlock of the prepatory Sejm, several prominent members of the Polish bourgeoisie (including delegates from Kiev, Danzig or Vilnius) gathered in the streets of the capital to hasten the process and demanding more rights for the people no belonging to the nobility. The burghers had been protesting the difference of treatment for years but it was the first time such an event was organized. While the mayor of Warsaw, Michael Konopka, was officially the main organizer of the march, it is widely understood that this was coordinated by Stanislaw Habsburg to strengthen his partisans in the Sejm. While completely pacific, going against Stanislaw could prove to provoke troubles with the Liberal movements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC5.D;Despite the news of the loss of the allegiance of the Cossack hosts and of the principality of Smolensk the Sejm continued to be deadlocked.

After weeks of debates 4 candidates demarked themselves : Franz von Schwarzenberg, a cadet of one of the greatest Bohemian nobility. Johannes von Wettin cousin of the duke of Prussia supported by Scandinavians. Sigismund von Wittelsbach, a neutral German prince that is amenable to much of the factions. And finally the Sejm must decide if Stanislaw Habsburg is put into the list or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC8.D;Democratic liberals in $COUNTRY$ have been ignored for a long time, the nobles ruling the country being content with allowing expression of discontent but doing nothing about it. The government of Warsaw has discovered a liberal plot to kill the current King and replace him with the shunned candidate Stanislaw Habsburg who would promulgate several reforms and abolish the Golden liberties. This plot was denounced by one of his members and the Army has raided the houses of the main leaders while an attempt of seditious members of the people to rise against us was squashed in blood. Most of the leaders were convicted of treason and executed while Stanislaw, who was apparently not aware of the conspiracy, has fled the country to avoid such a fate. The Rzeczpospolita endures, and the dominance of the Nobles as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The general consensus is that this will be the first Sejm to accomplish great changes for the Polish people and several Liberal groups have rallied around the Royal Palace to support the King and his supporters in the Sejm while the conservative denounce intimidation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC11.A;Let us hope Poland is made better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC12.T;The March constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC12.D;The Sejm of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has managed to defeat the Magnate opposition and implemented a wide series of reforms for the country : universal suffrage, end of serfdom, renewed federalism and independence from foreign countries. Crowds rejoice in the country as a brighter future appears for the Polish masses but in the same time the nobility and foreign powers intend to crush this democratic revolution. Meanwhile Stanislaw Habsburg has gained an impressive popularity and the old elective monarchy has been abolished, with his sons to succeed him as constitutional monarchs in the decades to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC12.A;Long live the reborn $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC13.T;Unrest in Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC13.D;While the Constitution was well accepted in Poland and Lithuania, the Uman Confederation has declared neutrality and took over the Ruthenian territories to 'protect' them from the instability. While not officially leaving the Commonwealth as Smolensk or the Cossacks did, it's still a blow for the Habsburg King who realizes that greater challenges will come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

PLC15.T;The Bar Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC15.D;Several magnates have gathered in the town of Bar to form a konfederacja, a group whose sole intent is to reverse the new constitution of the kingdom and preserve the 'golden liberties'. While rich and powerful they can not hope to vanquish the Constitutionnalists and have thus appealed to their support in Prague for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC15.A;Traitors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC16.T;Troubles in Warsaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC16.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has been kept weak for a century thanks to our involvement, assuring we had a loyal ally in the North-East to watch our border. It is the emperor that sponsored the Habsburgs on the Polish throne and yet they have declared a new regime and the end of diplomatic influence in their country. We can not stand idle : already disgruntled nobles have come to us for help. We must strike soon and end the Polish ambitions before they grow too powerful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The world will recognize our might under the gentle rule of the Habsburgky kings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC20.A;Long live Poland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC21.T;The End of the Commonwealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
PLC21.D;The Constitutionalists have been defeated by the combined forces of the Magnates and foreign powers who were not content with a strong Commonwealth thriving and its people freed! The Rzeczpospolita has been torn apart, the king Stanislaw Habsburg exiled along with other great Liberal figures. Now the Jagiellons of Prague have annexed western Poland while putting a cadet of their family on the throne of 'Poland', the first in 300 years. Little Poland has been reorganized as the duchy of Galicia with its capital in Krakow, while the Baltic coast has also been taken from Poland with Lithuania now a Scandinavian puppet. The only winners of this terrible treaty are the Ruthenians who have been given most of their claims in exchange for staying out of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

##################### The New Bohemian Events (Coded by Attalus, Localized by Periares #################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH1.T;The Inauguration of the Wenceslaus V Plaza;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH1.D;Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus V reigned during the years of the German Revolution and the subsequent Great German War. An ambitious emperor with cunning intellect, he was able to quell the revolts of the German liberals within the Holy Roman Empire and fought coalitions of various powers who were keen on preventing a Bohemian hegemony over Central Europe. But he was too successful for his own good, and "the Lion of the North", as he was called after his successes at slaying Scandinavian battalions, was eventually forced to sue for peace. Wenceslaus would be murdered the following year and would be succeeded by his son, Sigismund V. Sigismund V today opened a plaza in Prague which openly embraced his reactionary father in a pompous ceremony and promised that his father's successes will be emulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH1.A;The people celebrate an Empire of a thousand years!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH2.T;Sigismund V;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH2.D;Sigismund V came to power in a tender age of 10 after his father was unceremoniously assassinated. German liberals deny their involvement in this affair, and there are indeed rumours that it was done by the hands of the Bohemian aristocracy, but it was always clear to Sigismund V that his father was murdered by the cold hands of the German liberals. Despite his unfortunate early upbringing, he has shown to inherit many of his fathers desires for statecraft, and his desire to unite the HRE under a Bohemian leadership. His staunch reactionary political motivations make him unpopular beyond the Bohemian borders, but his promises for a return to glory make him popular among our aristocrats. Time will tell if his dreams would come to pass under his reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH2.A;An industrious man for an industrial era!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH3.T;The Zeil Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH3.D;Risen from ruins, the German liberal cause did not die after the failed revolution at the end of the last century. Indeed, it continued today as several students, scholars and judges remembered the large banquet on the Zeil, a renowned street in the city centre of Frankfurt thirty years ago. After some festivities, the petty noble and Grand Judge of the city of Dortmund had proclaimed in a moment of silence that resistance to the Bohemian yoke and the tyranny of the aristocracy shall not end, that those who fight for the cause will not separate and reassemble wherever it is required, until a Constitution for the HRE is established. Needless to say, the potentates of Germany and beyond are shocked that these acts of treason are still celebrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH3.A;Nothing bad ever happened to Frankfurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH4.T;The Zeil Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH4.D;The Court in Anvers was informed today that several renowned German liberals were holding a banquet in remembrance to the Zeil Oath, indeed an act of treason of the German liberals against the established order, in Frankfurt. While the upper echelons of the Burgundian society reacted in shock, most Germans within our borders either reacted with mild amusement or ecstasy over the rebirthed liberal cause in Frankfurt, the heart of the German nation. Only time can tell now, whether the German liberals will reignite the fire in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH4.A;N'oublions jamais!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH5.T;The Zeil Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH5.D;The Court in Prague was informed today that several renowned German liberals were holding a banquet in remembrance to the Zeil Oath, indeed an act of treason of the German liberals against the established order, in Frankfurt. While the Bohemian heartland, which is despised by the German liberals, reacted in shock, our Elbian and Danubian subjects within our borders reacted either with mild amusement or ecstasy over the rebirthed liberal cause in Frankfurt, the true heart of the German nation. Time will tell, whether the German liberals will reignite the fire in the HRE...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BOH6.D;The Court in $CAPITAL$ was informed today that several renowned German liberals were holding a banquet in remembrance to the Zeil Oath, indeed an act of treason of the German liberals against the established order, in Frankfurt. While the upper echelons of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ society could only watch in awe, the lower levels reacted either wild amusement or sheer ecstasy over the rebirthed liberal cause in Frankfurt, the true heart of the German nation. Time will tell, whether the German liberal cause will reignite the fire in the HRE... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH6.A;Liberalism runs onwards, powered by the approval of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOH7.T;Creation of the Wolfgang Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH7.D;The elder branch of the House of Jagiellon, to which the kings of Bohemia belong, deeply distrust the intentions of the cadet branch Jagiellon-Karlstein, which would succeed to the throne of Bohemia should the senior branch die out. Sigismund Ludwig Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein is the head of this cadet branch which grew infamous during the Great German War for having championed the liberal cause. This eventually led to the assassination of the father of Wolfgang, who dropped his first two names which were associated with the elder branch. Today, Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein announced in Dresden the creation of the Wolfgang Society which occupies itself with reformist tendencies, which seem to have gained ground among our population. Further observation of the situation is the only thing we can do for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH7.A;Reforms? In Bohemia? With Sigismund V?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH8.T;The Franconian Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH8.D;In the years after the Great German War, the Grand Duchy of Franconia, formerly a staunch reactionary stronghold, had transformed itself into a beacon of liberalism and hope for the peoples of Germany. Duke Leopold IV and his almost obsessive sponsorship of various intellectuals and creative artists are part for the reason for the announcement of former author and today's chancellor August von Rixdorf of a charter granting basic rights to the subjects of the Franconian throne, and introducing a democratically elected parliament with actual legislative powers. With the obvious inspiration taken from the Zeil Oath, concerns are raised over a potential interference by Sigismund V of Bohemia who warned of such actions in the wake of his ascension to the crown of Bohemia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH8.A;The Duke will be remembered fondly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.T;The Franconian Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.D;In a lunatic statement of the Franconian chancellory, liberal reforms have swept through the Grand Duchy of Franconia which already housed a number of exiled German poets and other apologists. While this is a clear affront to the Bohemian authority over Germany and can only be resolved through a brutal 'restoration of the status quo', the liberal factions of our court proposed the acceptance of this Franconian Charter of Rights to prevent bloodshed. This, however, would threaten our position as a reactionary stronghold of Germany and open the gates for vile Burgundian and Scandinavian influence. Sigismund V's cabinet has decided that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.A;"... we must defend the Empire from this Charter!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH9.B;"... war shall be no more.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH10.T;Sigismund V's intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH10.D;In a tragic twist of unfortunate events, Sigismund V was convinced by the scheming part of  his cabinet of ministers that he should overrule the decision met by the cabinet and to declare war on Franconia to remove the Franconian Charter of Rights and to remove the liberal Grand Duke Leopold IV. While this made the king unpopular among the higher levels of the Bohemian government, it was welcomed by fellow reactionary governments in Central Europe who fear that the Charter might find followers elsewhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH10.A;Sigismund V shall guide us to our triumph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH11.T;The $YEAR$ Fire of Nuremberg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH11.D;During the Bohemian Invasion of Nuremberg, a siege conducted by Bohemian soldiers led to a hellfire setting the city ablaze. Hundreds were killed, and Duke Leopold IV of Franconia was forced to flee his palace and found refuge in Londres. Wildly condemned to be willfully perpetrated by ill-willed Bohemian corporals, Sigismund V denied any involvement. The Burning of Nuremberg ended the reign of the liberal Leopold IV and the installation of his younger, more reactionary brother Hermann III as a Bohemian puppet. The anger over the fire will inevitably change the geopolitics of Germany.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH11.A;Let the city light our way to order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH12.T;The Närmberchlied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH12.D;The Närmberchlied, the Nuremberg Song, is an anthem written by Gottfried Wilhelm Eisler as a reaction the Great Fire of Nuremberg. The first line, "Deutsches Blut, geflossen in der kalten Nacht" (usually translated into English as "German blood was shed in the cold night"), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a constitution that respects the individual human a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for "Gleichheit, Einheit, Freiheit" (equality, unity, freedom), Eisler expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the rule of law, not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail. Due to the contemporary tense atmosphere, the Danubians have begun to use these three words as a slogan against the Bohemian authority and to end their arbitrary rule over the lands of the Danube.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

BOH14.T;The Nürnberglied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH14.D;The Nürnberglied, the Nuremberg Song, is an anthem written by Gottfried Wilhelm Eisler as a reaction the Great Fire of Nuremberg. The first line, "Deutsches Blut, geflossen in der kalten Nacht" (usually translated into English as "German blood was shed in the cold night"), was a thinly veiled insult and exclusion of the Bohemian people to the German cultural group and was not long after its first publication in Leipzig banned in the Kingdom of Bohemia. And yet, this ban only made this forbidden song, in the wake of recent events in Franconia, more popular among our youth and beyond our borders as more and more liberal secret societies are forming around a single, unifying line of the Nürnberglied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH14.A;"Gleichheit, Einheit, Freiheit";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH15.T;The Defenestration of Sigismund V;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH15.D;What started as a crackdown of a liberal association of students in Dresden quickly escalated into a nationwide series of revolts against the absolute and arbitrary rule of Sigismund V which has now strained one nerve too many: the Royal Guard, fed up with the destructive rule of Sigismund V, stormed the royal palace of Prague and forced his abdication in favour of Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein. And yet, Sigismund, as ambitious as one knows him, tried to flee in the same night and was caught by a corporal in a narrow street of the Wenceslaus V Plaza. Fueled by blind anger, the citizens forced Sigismund V to climb up The Church of Our Lady of the Snows and was promptly defenestrated from the top of the bell tower, killing the former Emperor instantaneously on impact with the ground...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH15.A;Long live King Ludwig Wolfgang I of Bohemia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH16.T;The End of the Thousand Years' Reich;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH16.D;The HRE nominally continued to exist even after the Great German War despite the apparent division of the empire among Scandinavian, Burgundian and Bohemian spheres of interest. Although a claim in name only, the Holy Roman Crown was still a powerful tool to possess and part of the modern Bohemian self-perception. This changed, however, with the ascension of liberal Ludwig Wolfgang I to the crown of Bohemia, who ruled in an unpretentious fashion, avoiding the pomp and lavish spending of his predecessors. And thus, he officially abdicated the position of (nominal) Holy Roman Emperor, with no successor to follow in his place. The Holy Roman Empire no longer exists, and yet Bohemia and all of Germany marches onwards, as the rays of dawn cover a new horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH16.A;"Altes Werk im neuen Gewand.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH17.T;The End of the Thousand Years' Reich;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH17.D;The HRE nominally continued to exist even after the Great German War despite the apparent division of the empire among Scandinavian, Burgundian and Bohemian spheres of interest. Although a claim in name only, the Holy Roman Crown was still a powerful tool to possess and part of the modern Bohemian self-perception. This changed, however, when Sigismund V, now pressured by liberal faction within his court who were able to outmaneuver reactionary aristocrats after the Great Fire of Nuremberg, today declared his abdication of the Holy Roman Crown, with no successor to follow in his place. Instead, as an attempt to stabilize the Kingdom of Bohemia, he announced that he would henceforth assume the title of hereditary emperor of Bohemia, ruling from $YEAR$ onwards as Emperor Sigismund I of Bohemia. This marks the end of the Thousand Years' Reich.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH17.A;"Altes Werk im neuen Gewand.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH18.T;The Trial of the 37;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BOH18.D;In the light of the coronation of Ludwig Wolfgang I, he ordered the arrest of the 37 citizens of Prague responsible for the Defenestration of previous king Sigismund V. These men, now simply dubbed "The 37 of Prague" were ordered to be executed for the extra-judicial maiming of the former head of the Jagiellon Dynasty. This move, although expected and understood to be out of fear that this regicide might become a source of inspiration for even more radical factions of Europe, was only announced after the 37 of Prague were judged by the High Court of Bohemia and executed through hanging on the outskirts of the capital. The feared reaction did not manifest itself, however. No tear was shed by the peasantry over these faceless agitators, and there were no celebrations held over their death in the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

TAR2.T;Peace in the Steppes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR2.D;The past few years have seen the Western Pontic steppe enjoy an era of relative peace, especially after the scale of violence and destruction seen during the XVIIth and XVIIIth century in the Wild Fields between Ukraine, Russia and Tatarstan. While in the West the Zaporizhian and Dnieper hosts watch the unstable Polish-Lithuanian south-eastern borders, the Don Cossacks have recognized the Prince of Ryazan as their liege. Only the Donets and Akhtuba hosts enjoy freedom, having conquered on their own lands from both the Crimean and Astrakhan Khanates. While border raids still happen it will need a change in the global situation to see the Cossacks hosts on the warpath. Should we unite into a single host, we might become one of the great powers of the East, and teach freedom to the oppressive magnates from the Commonwealth and the boyars from Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR2.A;We will see how long it lasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Only the Donets and Akhtuba hosts enjoy freedom, having conquered on their own lands from both the Crimean and Astrakhan Khanates. While border raids with the Tatars still happen it will need a drastic change in the global situation to see the Cossacks hosts back on the warpath : should one of the hosts be annexed, or their neighbours become too powerful they will surely unite into a single host and become a formidable force in their own right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TAR6.D;The Wild Fields, this area from the Pontic Steppe fought between bands of Slavic warriors and mercenaries who call themselves the Cossacks and the Tatar khanates has seen much bloodshed in the past centuries. The Cossacks hosts fought the Tatars, Russian and Polish ambitions, and amongst themselves while attracting serfs and slaves from their neighbors lured by the freedom of the Cossack lifestyle. The Wild fields had enjoyed an era of relative peace in the past few years but this status quo has been broken as the Cossack hosts now gather their men to face a new situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR6.A;What will happen to these lands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR10.T;The Succession of Selim III;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR10.D;The problem of succession has plagued the various khanates of the steppe since their creation. Even Crimea, the most civilized of them does not escape this rule. Most of the time the question was ruled out by the Ottomans who chose woever pleased them the most. Selim III is aging and he has two sons fighting for the throne. Selim is like his father, traditional and afraid of the changes of the West. Murad is his opposite : he went to study in Istanbul where he became a renowned scholar, even meeting the future king of Iraq and becoming an acquaintance of his. He fought on the side of the Reformers in the Ottoman Civil War, and now, with the influence of Constantinople shinking in the Black Sea, he has decided to come back. Selim has begun to plot the death of his brother and who knows how it will end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

203511.A;A new era for Crimea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR12.T;Standardization of the Tatar Language;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR12.D;Of the many reforms implemented by Murad II, the codification of the Tatar language is often seen as his most important legacy. Prior to the standardization of the Tatar language, various different dialects of the Tatar language were spoken throughout the Wild Fields, all with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. Literacy remained low amongst the Tatar peoples, in part due to their migratory nature but also largely due to the difficulty of learning the Arabic script the language was traditionally written in. Under the direction of Murad II, a new script based on the Roman one was developed for the Tatar language, and spellings and grammatical conventions were codified largely from the Crimean dialect. This allowed for the written language to be significantly easier to learn for both foreigners and native speakers, and opened up Crimea to an influx of Western ideas and literature. While the new standard was not initially popular outside the lands of the Crimean Khanate, with time these conventions would come to be adopted as the Standard Tatar language, especially as a Tatar national awakening began to emerge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203512.A;How do you read this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR13.T;Military Reforms of Murad II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR13.D;Perhaps the most significant factor contributing to the early successes of the Crimean state were Murad IIs reforms of the army of the Crimean Khanate. Having studied Western military tactics and doctrine of the last century, and having witnessed their effectiveness during the Ottoman Civil War, Murad II had become convinced of the need for military reform. While the previous hybridization of Turkish and Cossack military doctrines had fared well against the irregular forces normally encountered in the steppes by Tatar regiments, such tactics fared poorly in an open engagement between regular military forces. Thus, under Murad II, the lance was discarded in favor of the smoothbore, and a highly disciplined army unfettered by the cossack soldiers intimidation or provocation was formed. While initially unpopular, Murad IIs military reforms ensured the long-term survival of the Crimean state in the face of encroaching Cossack and Russian expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203513.A;This is my boomstick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR14.T;The Unification of the Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR14.D;Both the Russian principalities and the Cossack hosts have been hungrily eyeing Tatar lands for decades now, and both have been growing in power in recent years. For the Tatars to remain free from foreign subjugation, they must be united into a single nation powerful enough to resist foreign incursions. As the only Tatar polity to even resemble a modern state, the mantle falls upon us to unite our brethren under our benevolent rule and to drive the Russians and Cossacks out of Tatarstan. Our first step lies in the conquest of our neighbors to the north, the Astrakhan Khanate. While none of the Tatar khanates remain unscathed from the times of the Departure, the Astrakhan Khanate was the one most devastated by the conquests of the Cossack hordes. Despite decades having passed, the Astrakhan Khanate has yet to recover, only staving off foreign conquest due to the relative worthlessness of their lands to the Russians and the constantly shifting political situation amongst the principalities. Before the political tides change in Russia, we must conquer them and utilize what resources they do have to strengthen our own position in the Wild Lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203514.A;The Astrakhan Khanate is weak. We must seize the advantage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203514.B;Now is not the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR15.T;Conquest of Kazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR15.D;The Khanate of Kazan has been in slow decline for decades, and has only recently begun to recover from the Chayka Rebellion. With the Khan of Kazan increasingly relying on foreign support to maintain his rule, Kazan teeters on the edge of becoming little more than a Ryazanian client state. Before the Ryazanians can make their move, we must invade the Khanate of Kazan, and with our armies now experienced in the use of new tactics and weaponry after our conquest of Astrakhan we will no doubt make quick work of any forces Kazan may throw at us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203515.A;Surely our armies will not stop with just Astrakhan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203515.B;Perhaps it would be wise not to be too ambitious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.T;Djihad for Saraj the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.D;Saraj the Great. Located in the approximate geographical center of Tatar culture, this city represents much to the myriad peoples of the Steppes. Prior to its conquest by the Akhtuba Host, the city was the main source of wealth and power for the Astrakhan Khanate, controlling portage between the Don and Volga Rivers, and was even briefly the capital of the khanate after the Dzungar sack of Astrakhan. With the loss of the city to the peasant armies of Zarubin Chayka, the Astrakhan Khanate was left in shambles, and the whole Tatar nation was shaken by the loss of that magnificent city to the Cossack heathens. With our recent unification of the Tatar nation, prominent imams all across Tatar lands have called for a Djihad for the reconquest of Saraj the Great. We now stand at a crossroad; on one hand, such a move would surely unite the diverse peoples of our newfound Tatar state under a single banner, and would obtain for us a worthy city for the capital of our new nation. On the other hand, the fall of the Akhtuba Host would certainly rouse the other formerly neutral Cossack hosts into action against us, potentially creating an enemy we are not prepared to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.A;Onwards to Saraj the Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR16.B;We must not provoke the Hosts into uniting against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.T;The Fall of the Akhtuba Host;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.D;Truly, Allah is on our side! The heathens of the Akhtuba Host have fallen before our invincible armies, and much of the remaining Cossack interlopers have been driven out or killed. Saraj the Great now lies in our hands, never again to fall to the infidel. So claim the devout amongst us, anyway. Already, however, Cossack riders have been spotted broaching our borders, and cross-border raids from the remaining hosts have nearly ceased altogether. The more cautious warn that this is the calm before the storm, and that cossack forces are preparing for a massive war the likes of which has not been seen since the end of the cossack Departure. Whatever the case may be, should the remaining cossack hosts decide to mobilize against us, they will not find us unprepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR17.A;Let their armies break before us like waves crashing on a rocky shore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.T;The People of the Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.D;While nominally a nation united by Islam and opposition to Russian expansion, there exist great disparities between the various different peoples that constitute the Tatar nation. The Tatars of Crimea have long been within the Ottoman cultural sphere, while the Tatars of Kazan have grown to share certain commonalities with their Russian neighbors to the north. In addition to this, recent overtures in Crimea to opening up to the West have led to an influx of ideas regarding secularization and the rights of man throughout the lands of the former khanate, meanwhile large parts of the Tatar population outside of Crimea have grown to resent this trend of increasing liberalism in Crimea. These two factions will almost certainly create much friction as the new Tatar nation struggles to define what it exactly means to be a Tatar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR18.A;To be a Tatar is to live free from foreign yoke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.T;Troubles brewing in Ryazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.D;Unlike its northern neighbours, the Princedom of Ryazan holds little esteem for the title of Prince and has embraced the tradition of elective monarchy of its most powerful neighbour, albeit sugar-coating it with token remembrances of ancient Slavic customs. The Ryazanian Duma has always picked a Repnin since the union of the princess Anastasia with Nicholas Repnin, but the possibility of declaring loyalty to a charismatic unifier, like during the time of the Troubles, remains a very possible outcome. The real power in Ryazan thus lies not in the hands of the Prince but in the hands of the nobility leaders assembled in the Duma. Currently, Michael II Repnin rules in Ryazan and his fondness of military affairs (that gave him the nickname of 'Prince-in-the-barracks') has led many boyars to believe that he is not very interested in politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR21.A;It will pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.T;The coup of Michael II;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.D;Despite appearances, Michael II, the so-called 'Prince-in-the-barracks' had been creating an ever-growing network of collaborators, especially among the Cossacks from the Don Host. His contempt for serfdom and boyar excesses has become more and more evident over the past few months and he finally decided to make his opinion known by assembling the Duma in his palace of Ryazan. Cossacks then surrounded the chamber where Michael II had called the nobles, while he attempted to proclaim the dissolution of the assembly and his reign as autocrat of Ryazan. The boyars were taken by surprise at first, but soon fighting erupted as the nobles launched their own retinues against the Cossack guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.A;The Coup is successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR22.B;Boyars take control of the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.T;Victory of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.D;Michael II had succeeded in his coup. He is now autocrat of Ryazan with all power over the state, a feat that no Prince of Ryazan has managed since the times of Alexander II Repnin 'the Gunpowder Prince.' The Boyars' have been crushed, many lying dead and the few remaining either rallied to him or are in shackles. One of the first actions he took was the release of the Don Host from their allegiance. Cossacks had helped him access true power, and he thus had to pay his debt to them. However the alliance between the ataman Beketov and the prince endured, and Michael II still retained many Cossack advisors in his court and own army. Among them was the notorious commander of the guard, soon promoted to general of the Prince's armies, Yemelyan Razin, who was soon to be recognized as one of the finest commanders of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR23.A;Until another day, Cossacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.T;Victory of the Duma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.D;The fight begun by Michael II ended poorly for the Prince. As the Boyars fought for their lives, the Prince himself was killed in the fray of battle, with his Cossack guards either meeting the same fate or surrendering. The Boyars soon crowned the nephew of Michael II, Pyotr Repnin as his successor. A weak boy aged 13, he would be no danger to the power of the Duma. The various nobles now had to take a stance towards the Don Host. The ataman Pyotr Beketov has already announced that he was loyal to the Prince and did not recognize the new prince, hosting the son of Michael II, Alexander, in their territory as the legitimate heir. We could let these peasants go as they have been a thorn in our side for decades or move to directly annex them, although that may stir the other Cossacks against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.A;Let the Host go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR24.B;We will take back our lands from this 'host'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR25.T;The Cossack threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR25.D;As we feared the Cossacks have united following our takeover of the Don host. While it may seem unimportant, these Cossacks claim the lands we have taken and thus could strike against us when the fight with the other principalities begin. It is thus of the utmost importance that we strike first and place various loyal atamans to rule the steppe in our name.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR25.A;Down with the Cossacks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.T;Victory over the Cossacks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.D;The feared Cossack bands were no matched for the armies of Ryazan who crushed their resistance and forced them to come to terms. The general Rada would be abolished, with the various hosts created again with loyal atamans placed at their helm. Now the South waits for Ryazan and soon Russian orders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR26.A;A mighty victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.T;Defeat in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.D;Our ambitions were too grandoise, and our armies could not defeat the bands of hastily prepared peasants of the South. We have lost our opportunity to create a strong state in the South and may never gain such an opportunity again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR27.A;A sad day for Ryazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.T;Renew the Departure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.D;The Akhtuba host was founded as the last free Cossack host, on the ruins of the Chayka rebellion and the Turgut attack on the Astrakhani. We have spent decades defeating the various Tatar rebellions and raiders in our territory but it is not enough. As the princes of the North and even the Tatars themselves change, we must also renew our conquests of the Wild Lands and end the Astrakhani khanate once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.A;Let us end the Mohamedan !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR28.B;We cant do that;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.T;The Ukrainian Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.D;Ukraine has been formed in the West by the various Cossack hosts as a means of protecting our way of life from invaders. We were not included in the original deal because of our power and also fierce independence, but as years go on and we see the stability brought by this new state, it seems to many that it would be in our interest to join our brothers under one Host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.A;Ukraine is the path forward !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR29.B;Our independence cant be negotiated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR30.T;The Akhtuba Cossacks join us !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR30.D;The Akhtuba host that didnt join our state after the general Rada has approached us seeking to join our glorious federation!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR30.A;Long live Ukraine !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR31.T; Stepan Sternenkos ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR31.D;As the Cossack hosts finally threw out the Polish officials and declared independence, the Dnieper host elected Stepan Sternenko as their new Hetman. A renowned mercenary who was forbidden by Warsaw to come back to his homeland because of his experience in the German Wars and also the Hungarian Independence War, he is widely seen as one of the Cossack national heroes. But his friends and allies know that his ambitions are wild and he sees himself as the successor of the Blue Hetman, Semen Bilozersky that had unified the people of Ukraine against the Commonwealth. And he is ready to destroy anyone who might try to hinder his work.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR31.A;Who does he think he is ?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.T;Sternenkos move;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.D;As the Rada convened in Kharkov, Hetman Sternenko began his speech by referring to the Blue Hetman uprising of the XVIIth century. Since his defeat, Cossacks in Western Ukraine had lived under the Polish boot and the various hosts were used as pawns for foreign designs. With their new independence, the Dnieper Cossacks were designated by God to unify the Wild Lands, by force if need be, and for this to happen, Sternenko demanded full war-powers and the end of the Rada convenings until unification. As the votes are cast ;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR32.A;Sternenko secures power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR32.B;Sternenko loses power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR33.T;Reunification of the Western Host;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR33.D;The Western Cossacks had been united in a single host before the Polish forcefully separated the lands between the Dnieper and Zaporizhian hosts. Now is the time to end the pesky southern host and unify Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR33.A;For Cossack unity !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR34.T;Securing the Donets;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR34.D;The Donets basin was settled by independent Cossacks in the Departure Era, and has many times been threatened by the heathen Crimean sultanate. We have the duty to protect them from the Muslims and secure these vital black lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR34.A;For Cossack victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.T;Ending the Northern lapdogs;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.D;The Don Cossacks pledged themselves to the Princedom of Ryazan long ago and their new independence still is plagued by the influence of their boyars. We must strike against them to secure a strong and pure Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR35.A;For Cossack purity !;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.T;Failure of Sternenko;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.D;The ambitions of the Hetman were ended as he suffered defeat in his unification wars. His opponents profited from this to convene a new Rada and end his Hetmanate, leaving him to flee for his life abroad. Now the Ukrainian plains return to peace and their old ways of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR36.A;Defeat means peace at least;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR37.T;Sternenkos ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR37.D;At last, Ukraine has been united under the protection of Sternenko and his valorous soldiers. But now is the time for ruling. Already over the course of his campaigns, Sternenko made several laws modernizing the Host and turning into a real state like the rest of the West. Lingering Cossack influences have already hindered his efforts, but it seems that Ukraines future as a united polity is secure. But many wonder what this state will be : Sternenko has harboured some ambitions for his office to become hereditary and thus make Ukraine a monarchy, but he has fought along many Republicans in his life and could give powers to a renewed Chorna Rada.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR37.A;A Cossack Republic is what we need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR37.B;The Hetman shall lead as our monarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR37.C;Nothing really needs to change;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR38.T;The Kazan threat;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR38.D;After taking back power from the hands of the Duma, Michael II set his eyes on his neighbor : the Khanate of Kazan. The Khanate has been declining for decades, and held only because of the help we provided in putting down the Chayka rebellion that saw slaves rebel all along the Volga and threatened to spill into the serfs of Ryazan. Now Michael II wants to erase this shameful past and secure his rule and glory by pushing the Khanate to the Volga. An extensive campaign of conquest cannot be undertaken with the threat of the other princedoms but the Ryazanian court thought that reducing Tartar territory could only be helpful in the troubles to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR38.A;To the Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR38.B;We cannot risk it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR39.T;Volga-Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR39.D;Ryazan has begun to avenge its past of humiliations at the hands of the steppe demons. Ryazanian armies swept the hordes of Kazan to the other side of the Volga and lands are already put to culture while our boats roam the Volga. Michael II returned to Ryazan hailed by the population and it seems to many of his neighbors that Ryazan will be a tough opponent in any fight to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR39.A;All hail Michael !;;;;;;;;;;;;;  
TAR40.T;Setback in the steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR40.D;The plans of the Prince did not guarantee victory. It seems the Tatars are far from being uncivilized savages as many assumed, and our soldiers learnt it as they were forced back to our lands. Many wonder how Michael II could recover from such a blow to his rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR40.A;How could it happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.T;An unstable Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.D;Uniting our people under one banner was easy, but making them accept that Ukraine needs to endure as a modern state for the Cossack spirit not to die has been harder. Many want to continue the lives of their forefathers as free men in the Dyke Pole with no state to watch them. The next Rada will be decisive for the future of Ukraine and its people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.A;Let us go back to the Hosts of yore !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR41.A;Ukraine will endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.T;The visit of John Carnegie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.D;A strange man has appeared in Kharkov the other day. Claiming to be the son of a rich industrialist from Scotland, John Carnegie has apparently embarked on a trip throughout Eastern Europe to see the fierce and independent spirit of the Eastern Slavs in the open steppe. A romantic at heart, he has spent days with various Cossack hosts inspecting our borders and our lands, always astonished by our ways of life and the wilderness of our lands. He has proposed a partnership with the industrial conglomerate of his father to help $THIS$ develop although it will surely take years to be realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR42.A;A most peculiar visit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.T;The creation of Karnegove;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.D;Following his last visit, John Carnegie has lobbied several bankers and fellow industrials to support his endeavors in our lands. Securing a large capital, he came back to Ukraine with the goal of building a metalwork factory in the Donbass where the abundance of coal is notorious. Our council of state has made him an honorary citizen of Ukraine and the town that sprung up around him was soon called 'Karnegove'. There, the finest steel of the East is produced and fuels a nascent industrialization of our nation. Carnegie has organized the factory on a 'socialist' model with schools and housing for his employees, hoping to create a perfect society in the middle of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR43.A;Steel makes us stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.T;The Donbass boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.D;The whole Donets basin is filled with coal and iron making it a natural area for industrialization to launch. Following the establishment of Karnegove several of the Cossack leaders have assembled in companies to exploit the riches of the Donbass, as foreign banks heavily invested in what many deem the 'best investment' there is right now in Europe. Many Cossacks have thus abandoned their small farms for the halls of the factories and the coal pits, ensuring the wealth of Ukraine and a rising standard of living throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR44.A;Let us all profit from this boom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.T;The lamentations of Carnegie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.D;Few news have reached us from the manor of Karnegove where the founder of the city has secluded himself for months. A mystical man at heart, he blames himself for the transformations of Ukraine and its people. His last speech to his employees  was written down by a journalist : 'Black smoke rises from the Ukrainian factories as it does in Scotland. Countless children are sacrificed in the pits or the factories where they once benefited from a humble but pure life in the Wild Fields...' He went on and on for nearly an hour before collapsing. The transformation is real, but at least his model factory continues to be a beacon of hope for many workers of the Donbass who crave the same housing and education provided in Karnegove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR45.A;A strange end for the Steelman;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR46.T;Opening of Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR46.D;"Rada" usually referred to an assembly of Cossack commanders, which were convened by the hetmans to resolve disputed issues. This time, however, the Rada looks quite different. At the Rada, which determines the structure and life of the unified Cossack state, absolutely everyone is allowed in, even ordinary soldiers, and they are given the same right to vote as the most influential commanders. Such an approach has increased the legitimacy of Ukraine and its Hetman, who is now respected by all parts of the Cossacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR46.A;Our fate is in our own hands now.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.T;Question of Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.D;Despite the fact that Ukraine is considered a free land, in some Cossack hosts there is a wide layer of debt slaves and landless peasants who "voluntarily" work for the landowners. A large number of common Cossacks support the abolition of this system and the establishment of fair pay for all throughout Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.A;Serfdom in Ukraine? No way!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR47.B;We can't just abolish our customs...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.T;Question of State;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.D;The problem of host autonomy is perhaps the most pressing issue at this Rada. Despite the fact that the lands of Ukraine have been conquered by its unifier, local elites still count on some degree of autonomy. Will Ukraine be a centralized state, or a confederation of different regions, troops, and cities?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.A;The modern state have to be centralized!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR48.B;Confederation? Where have I heard that word before...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.T;Question of Military;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.D;At this point, our military forces are more like large bands than a regular army. Despite their combat effectiveness, Cossack military tactics are not formalized, and the creation of Western-style officer academies has not been successful. Few understand the need for modernization, and it is unclear whether their arguments will convince their opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.A;United army for a united nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR49.B;No need to rush...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.T;Question of Voting rights;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.D;The Cossacks have a long tradition of collective decision-making. Often, even officers were elected from among the most respected soldiers, even if they were not the most competent tacticians and strategists... Obviously, the government in Ukraine will be elective, but the question is, who will elect it? It is clear to every Cossack that only the one holding a weapon in his hand has the right to choose, but the few liberals among the Cossack elite propose to give the right to vote to every man in Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.A;A voting citizen is a happy citizen.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR50.B;The right to vote has to be earned;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.T;Question of Hetman;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.D;The question of hetman rule had long been on the agenda. Not everyone likes the fact that a man once elected can count on power for the rest of his life, even if he no longer deserves it. A proposal was made to elect a hetman every few years, so that it would be clear that we are ruled by the most worthy one at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.A;Cossack Monarchy is our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR51.B;Long live the Cossack Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.T;Success of the Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.D;Despite the squabbles and arguments, those present at the Rada were still able to come to an agreement. The written Constitution of Ukraine will become the basis of our state and a symbol of unity of the Cossack people, which happened for the first time in 200 years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR52.A;Glory to Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.T;Failure of the Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.D;Despite our seeming success in unifying Ukraine, we were unable to impose our will on the rest of the hosts. The draft Constitution of Ukraine, proposed by the Hetman, was a dismal failure, destroying his authority in the eyes of even his closest supporters. Various influential figures are already declaring themselves hetmans and restoring their independence, and it is up to us whether this process will be peaceful or whether we will once again show our strength and bring our enemies to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.A;A dream of Ukraine is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR53.B;To arms, khloptsi!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR54.T;Collapse of Chorna Rada;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR54.D;The situation at the Rada has heated up to the limit. Grouped into small parties, the Cossack elite and its subordinates cannot agree on a single issue. The word of the Hetman decides nothing, and no one listens to his opinion anymore. The elite accuses him of letting the "mob" into the Rada, while ordinary Cossacks blame him for compromises and his inability to demonstrate his leadership, for which he was loved by the soldiers. Delegations leave the Rada, and it has become clear to everyone that it is impossible to unite Ukraine by force of words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.T;Victory over separatists;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.D;Despite the fact that the starting situation in this civil war seemed deplorable, we were able to subdue all the rebellious areas and establish our authority there. Now that we have no serious political opponents left, we can implement our vision for the future of Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR55.A;Glory to Ukraine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TAR56.T;Ruina;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR56.D;The war has exhausted the resources of all sides. We could not defeat the separatists, which means that dreams of a united Ukraine have been postponed for several more decades, if not forever. Weakened and divided, the land of the Cossacks is now open to conquest from all sides...;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
TAR56.A;What have we done;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
##################### Malta Stuff (Coded by Attalus} #################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
MLT1.T;An old and sick Grandmaster;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT1.D;The Order of Saint John has settled in Malta back in 1573, liberating the land from the Ottoman corsairs that had settled there. Our legacy endures but right now the current Grandmaster, Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, has been plagued by outbreaks of tuberculosis. While still maintaining his power, it is no secret that the head of the Auvergne tongue (administrative division of the order), the recently arrived Jean de Montfort-Laval would take advantage of this state to call a new election. But with Aragon protecting the status quo through their loyal head of the Aragonese tongue, Pons De Margarit de Biure, Montfort-Laval and his supporters will only act if the Dual-Monarchy were to take an increased role in the Mediteranean, although the Plantagenet king is already the official patron of the order. For the moment, the island is calm but who knows for how long ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT1.A;Trouble is brewing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.T;The Grandmaster of Malta ill;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT2.D;News have reached the European court that the current Grandmaster of the order of Saint John, Pietro Cheschi a Santa Croce, has been plagued by outbreaks of tuberculosis. While still maintaining his power, it is no secret that the head of the Auvergne tongue (administrative division of the order), the recently arrived Jean de Montfort-Laval has expressed that he wanted to take advantage of this state to call a new election, considering Cheschi unfit to maintain his power.

MLT6.T;Change in Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.D;The crown of Aragon has been the feudal overlord of the Order because the island belonged to the crown of Sicily before the Alfonsine concession of 1579. But now Aragon has lost the island and many wonder what it entails for Malta. Several groups have agitated in the previous days : the Knights are commonly hated by the population and many wish to throw them out the island for good. Among these factions many Irrendentists wish the island to join with their Italian brothers in Sicily. But in the end the Knights still possess the artillery and weapons and could try to crush this uprising. Who shall dictate the path of Malta ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT6.A;The independent Republic of Malta!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

MLT11.D;The hold on the Knights grew weaker over the years as the newfound independence gave several ideas to the Maltese intellectuals who already hated the Knights when they were just 'Aragonese lapdogs'. Following several economic crises and scandals involving Knights and especially the head of the English tongue, the Nationalists decided to organize a demonstration in the capital of Porto Ferrante. From there Ugo Buhagiar, leader of the Nationalists tried to lead his supporters to take the Palace of the Grandmaster and proclaim the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.A;The Grandmaster is toppled : long live the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT11.B;The crowd is dispersed by the Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.T;A meeting in Marseilles;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.D;Jean de Montfort-Laval was never meant to become a Knight. The first heir of one of the greatest noble families of the Kingdom, he had to flee and become a Knight following a duel provoked by a remark of the poet Maurice de la Rochefoucauld over his sister. Arriving in Malta at the age of 21 he soon used his prestige and charisma to climb the levels of the order and become the second most powerful man in Malta. With our conquest of the Valois duchy, he has come on an embassy to negotiate officially the status of the Provence tongue possessions in our Kingdom. But in private he has asked for the support of the Rex Christianissimus, should the Grandmaster step down, and promised us to become our foremost ally in the Mediteranean. His ambitions may be high, but Malta could be used as a friendly base on the road to the Levant and would foremost lower the power of Aragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT12.A;The Pact of Marseilles is signed;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT13.T;The Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT13.D;For years, the young head of the Auvergne tongue, Jean de Montfort-Laval has criticized the current Grandmaster for holding on to power while his life resumes to lying in bed or visiting sanatoriums. The pressure has been high for Pietro Cheschi who finally decided to abdicate following the latest attacks in the Holy Council. A new election is to be called to select the 75th Grandmaster and it will surely be a contentious one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT13.A;Let us thanks Pietro Cheschi for his service.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT14.T;Abdication of Pietro Cheschi;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT14.D;The Grandmaster of the order of Malta has abdicated because of his bad health. At least that's the official version : the head of the Aragonese tongue has contacted us to inform us of the latest maneuvers of the Dual-Monarchy, patron of the Order since the XVIIth century and which currently supports the young Jean de Montfort-Laval. Our ambassadors fear that they may try to place their puppet to increase their influence and make the island their possession and not ours. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT14.A;The election is a game we can win!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT15.T;A contentious election;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT15.D;The election of the 75th Grandmaster is contentious. Montfort-Laval hoped to win the election without any problems, but his influence is as high as the hatred and contempt he inspires many of his brothers. The head of the German tongue, Karl Von Preysling, has even retired to the German inn in the port, refusing to take part in the process because of the irregularities he has witnessed. For now the election is thus blocked...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT15.A;Such infighting...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.T;News from Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT16.D;As the prime Catholic nation of Europe, we have an interest in the direction of the Order of Saint John in Malta, with most of the German knights hailing from our country or our allies. The Apostolic legate in Prague has contacted us because the head of the German tongue (administrative division of the order) in Malta, Karl von Preysling is blocking the election process of the Grandmaster because of his personal hatred of the main candidate Jean de Montfort-Laval. We exert a lot of influence amongst the German brothers and could force Von Preysling to come back to the table of negotiations. The Pope has informed us that the rivalry between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy is a great concern : we could push Von Preysling to make a bid to become Grandmaster and establish a new relation of the Order with his patrons, or we could just instruct him to end the election as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.A;The Kaiser wants Von Preysling to become Grandmaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT16.B;The Kaiser just wants the end of this political drama.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT17.T;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ interference;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT17.D;The election is not as smooth as Monfort promised us. He has been challenged because of his youth and of several rivalries he made since his arrivals. Among these, the offended Karl von Preysling has recently come back to the Holy Council for the election, proposing himself as a neutral and peaceful choice for Grandmaster. We had heard of the interest of the Prague court in these matters but we did not envision they would use their influence for such a thing. Several Italian knights have joined Von Preysling because of Papal manipulations and we are now forced to demand Spain to put pressure on their knights in the Portuguese and Castilian tongues to ensure that our investment in Montfort-Laval succeeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT17.A;Contact the Spanish ambassador, they will feel important for once.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT18.T;A demand from Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT18.D;The Order of Saint John has convened for a new election following the retirement of the previous Grandmaster. Our influence there is not so strong with the Spanish knights representing a fringe minority in the ranks of the Order but as the election grows more decisive the Anglois choice of Jean de Montfort-Laval faces increased competition. The head of the Spanish knights, Pedro de Olivares has yet to pronounce his judgement and our friends in Paris have asked us for our support. Supporting them is the best course of action since it will surely weaken Aragon while enhancing our position in European diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT18.A;Contact Olivares, he has a favour to honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.T;Ending the stalemate;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT19.D;Factionalism has grown over the previous weeks as European diplomats sent various messages to Malta to instruct the Knights from the wishes of the sovereigns of their homelands. 3 candidates are still in the competition : Jean de Montfort-Laval's ambitions are still strong and he hopes to end the current situation of the Order with Aragon thanks to the protection of Paris counting on the support of most of the Anglois and Spanish knights. On the other hand Pons Margarit de Biure proclaims that he is a traitor and can count on the votes of the Aragonese knights. Meanwhile Karl von Preysling has come back, promoting himself as a compromise candidate, who with the backing of the Papacy and the Emperor in Prague wishes to affirm neutrality from both Aragon and Dual-Monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.A;Karl von Preysling becomes the LXXVth Grandmaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.B;Monfort-Laval wins despite all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT19.C;Margarit de Biure confirms the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.T;A new situation in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT20.D;Our candidate in the election has lost but at least the Anglois Montfort did as well! The new German knight has the support of Prague and also Rome, as the Holy Father has been angered by the various intrigues that plagued the succession of Pietro Cheschi. The Apostolic legate has thus drafted a plan that would see our feudal contract ended with the Order while making sure that the archipelago would not be used by a foreign power against us, notably the Dual-Monarchy. With the intervention of the Pope it seems hard to go against this situation and Malta isn't really worth the hassle after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.A;The end of an era...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT20.B;We don't accept the Convention!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT21.T;The Convention of Porto Ferrante;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT21.D;Following the election of Karl von Preysling as the 75th Grandmaster of the Order of Saint John, he asked the Aragonese King to change the feudal contract that binded the Order to the King of Sicily by assuming neutrality in the Mediteranean. Following the vicious infighting that the election caused, this solution was supported by the Curia who had sent the first draft to Barcelona about this new situation. Malta would be ceded to the Order in full, with the Knights promising to observe neutrality outside of their protection duties. The Convention was then signed in Porto Ferrante by both representatives from the Anglois and Aragonese Kings, leading to the end of their relationships with the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT21.A;The Knights protect the island and nothing more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT22.T;The Maltese Falcon;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT22.D;Following the election of Karl von Preysling received a letter of thanks for his support along with a magnificent Maltese Falcon. The bird had been the symbol of the feudal relationship between the Order and Barcelona and Karl von Preysling had decided that it was only fitting that his Imperial Majesty received the last of these gifts. The animal would be given to Princess Elisabeth, the first born of the Emperor who would begin a tradition of hunting with only Maltese falcons. Along with her other eccentricities, the bird would become a symbol, many of the Bohemian Imperial family members being painted or later taking photos of them with these Falcons, often nicknamed the 'Imperial Falcon'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT22.A;The Bohemian Eagle deserves such a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT23.T;Election of Montfort-Laval;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT23.D;What we feared happen, the Anglois protégé and ambitious knight, Jean de Montfort-Laval was elected by the Holy Council to lead the Order. For now he has publicly sent us our Maltese Falcon as a sign of his submission to the current agreements between the Order and our sovereign but behind closed doors, it is no secret that he dreams of an independent Malta, with him girdling a Crown...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT23.A;We will have to watch him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT24.T;An ally in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT24.D;Our ally, Jean de Montfort-Laval has won the election in Malta. In a secret letter to our goverment he has assured us that he will move quite soon against the current status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT24.A;New opportunites arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT25.T;The Grand-principality of Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT25.D;The Order of Saint-John has been criticzed for decades about his general lack of utility in the modern world. With piracy in the Mediteranean ended, they have been left without a cause and hated by the general population of the archipelago because of the heavy taxation. The latest Grandmaster, Jean de Montfort-Laval took advantage of this situation to coup the Holy Council, the administrative head of the Order by declaring himself Grand-Prince of Malta, and nationalising the Order, while allowing the Knights who swore fealty to him to remain. He then promulgated a charter to associate the Maltese elites, making him vastly popular on the islands. Now, even with the Anglois protection he must face the Aragonese who are still the de jure masters of the islands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT25.A;Long live our Prince !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.T;A prince in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT26.D;The proclamation of the Grandmaster as Prince of Malta and the nationalisation of the order surprised many despite the knowledge that he was up to some scheme. But now we are faced with a dilemma : either we recognize the actions of 'John I' of Malta and his independence or we will have to fight the Dual-Monarchy who has already recognized the new monarch of the islands. Is Malta really worth a war with the greatest power of Europe ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.A;Recognize his independence, he only rules three worthless rocks!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT26.B;The archipelago is a possession of the Crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT27.T;Safe from Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT27.D;The gamble from the Prince had worked : Aragon forfeited its claims over our archipelago, fearful of the protection from our friends in Paris. It is a new era for Malta, which is now independent. To celebrate this, John I decided to sail back to his homeland to thank the Anglois court for their support (and secure a wedding prospect now that he had been liberated from his vows), and upholding his promise of being a trusted ally in the Mediteranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT27.A;All is calm in Malta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT28.T;The election of Pons Margarit de Biure;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT28.D;Pons Margarit de Biure, head of the Aragonese tongue of the Knights of Saint John has been elected Grandmaster of the Order. This news was met with joy in Barcelona given that he was the candidate of the King and the only one who supported the current relationship Malta has with the Crown. He also has opposed the Anglois interests in the islands, denouncing in particular Jean de Montfort-Laval who was accused of treason and thrown into prison following the discovery of several letters indicating his plots against the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT28.A;Long live the LXXVth Grandmaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT29.T;The election;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT29.D;Karl von Preysling has finally come back to his senses, announcing his support of Margarit de Biure against Jean de Montfort-Laval. With the German knights denouncing him along with a general lack of support from most of the various tongues, the chances of Montfort being elected have quite faded.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT29.A;Jean de Montfort-Laval wins despite the fierce opposition!;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT28.B;Pons de Margarit de Biure wins a large victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MLT30.T;A princely visit;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT30.D;The new prince of Malta has come to Paris following the celebrations of the new Maltese independence and the general reorganization of the state. As he is welcomed by the King, ministers discuss the new alliance between the archipelago and the Dual-Monarchy, securing the use of the naval bases in times of peace and war. Anglois capitalists discuss the opening of this new market while the Prince announced his marriage to the third removed cousin of the King, the duchess of Longueville. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
MLT30.A;A new era for Malta and the Dual-Monarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
##################### Synøe Events (Coded by Attalus} #################################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.T;The Pearl of the Antilles;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.D;The Southern Islands, or as we call them the Synøe, are the pride of the Scandinavian colonial empire. The archipelago comprised of the main island of Kiskøyene and the secondary island of Righavn, is one of the main sources of colonial products be it sugar, coffee or chocolate. The slave population far surpasses the local settlers who come mainly from Scandinavia although many of the lower classes trace their ancestry to some Scottish clans deported them for their support during the Anglois occupation in the XVIIIth century. This pearl of the Antilles relies on slavery and we are sure to hear the settlers demand concessions if we were to abolish this practice.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ1.A;It's not on the agenda, yet.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.T;The Abolition of Slavery;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.D;The law outlawing slavery has passed following a growth of Liberal thought in our country. But in the Caribbean this Act of the Rigsdag has seen wide condemnation from the settlers who condemn idealists knowing nothing of their lives and the benefits of slavery. They demand that the state assumes the financial loss they have to suffer because of the Act, a compromise many Liberals accept because of the infringment on private property this Act represents.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.A;We will pay for the emancipation of their slaves. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ2.B;Paying for having freed men, what nonsense is this ?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.T;The Kiskøyener Manifesto;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.D;Pamphlets and slogans flourish in the Caribbean against Scandinavian rule following the refusal of Copenhagen to consider the side of the Kiskøyener planters. For many this is another sign that the relationship with the metropolis must end, as the island has no representation in Parliament and must always abide to the laws dictated by men who know nothing of the life in the Southern Islands. The Kiskøyener manifesto from Peter MacKristian is the most known of these works, and has become the main subject of conversation amongst the White population.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ3.A;They are just a colony, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.T;The independence of the Republic of Kiskøyene;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.D;As the situation of our state grew dire in the Antilles and abroad, the resistance against our rule increased. In these new circumstances, the old Planter elite along with the rest of the population declared the independence of the United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn, throwing away the representatives of Copenhagen and cutting ties with the metropolis.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.A;These islands were a burden anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ4.B;We will reconquer the Synøe !;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.T;The new Kiskøyener movement;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.D;In the last decades of the XIXth century, the islands of Sydøen experienced a national awakening. Distance from the motherland along with a difference in climate and general society had always made the Creole natives wary of the 'Northern' administrators. But the abolition of slavery led to a greater miscegenation among the lower classes, and the growing sentiment that the various populations, in all their differences, from the 'pure' Scandinavian Creole planters, to the mixed lower classes born from the mixing of Highlanders, Danish sailors and African slaves, had a common destiny and formed one nation. From autonomists to nationalists, all clamour for a new relationship with Scandinavia, which should hear them if it doesn't want conflict to erupt on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ5.A;Sydøen or Kiskøyene, call it as you want!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.T;The Sydøen dominion;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.D;Demands of autonomy have grown over the years in our Antillean colonies, their people demanding a new relationship with the metropolis. As their societies developed and grew, it seemed inevitable to many that the Scandinavian government would have to grant them some power. It seems the easier way to maintain our control over these islands would be to associate them as a Dominion of the Crown, with their diplomacy aligned with the decisions in Copenhagen while leaving them masters of their economy, health and education. We could refuse that deal, but it would bolster the nationalist cause.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.A;We welcome the new dominion.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.B;They are not developed enough for that.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ6.C;We welcome the new dominion ! (play as them);;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.T;Competition in the New-World;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.D;The rise of the New World powers has been a great concern for Scandinavia in the later years. Many Kiskøyener nationalists created exiled networks in these countries, rising public opinion against us. Then, they started coming back, harrassing the colonial police over the previous weeks. Now the situation has grown dire, with most of our forces in the islands trapped by the nationalists who proclaimed the independent United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn, waiting for their benefactor to support them.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ7.A;What just happened?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ8.T;Fight for independence!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ8.D;The day has come! We will not let the Scandinavian oppress us anymore, it is time to rise up or die free!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ8.A;Liberty or Death!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.T;A Contact from $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.D;The inhabitants of the islands of Kiskøyene and Righavn have risen up against the Scandinavian oppressor and demand our help. For several years we hosted exiles and trained some of their men in hope to reduce European influence in the Caribbean, now is the time!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.A;Europeans must go back to Europe!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ9.B;It is better not to provoke them...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.T;The reconquest of Sydøen;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.D;Our forces were paralysed by the declaration of the seditious Sydøer, but we have rallied and drafted several plans to retake the archipelago. We must be careful since the insurgents have contacted the powers of the New-World which have already declared their support of the new 'Republic'.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.A;Our Navy will sail the Atlantic to end this petty republic.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ10.B;Let it go...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.T;The reconquest of Sydøen;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.D;The pathetic attempts of the Sydøer to gain the support of the powers of the New World have failed. They stand alone agains the might of Scandinavia and it will be easy for our Navy to end their dreams of independence!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.A;Let us sail for the Sydøen!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ11.B;Perhaps we should let them alone ?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ12.T;Scandinavian decline;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ12.D;As Scandinavian power declined on the world stage over the years, the hopes of the nationalists in Sydøen rose. Our might is not what it was, and the locals saw it as less ships and colonial forces were put in the islands. In this situation, the nationalists gathered over the previous weeks, harassing local police forces and soldiers. Yesterday they felt strong enough to storm the palace of the governor and declare the independence of the United Republic of Kiskøyene and Righavn. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ12.A;It can't end like this ?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.T;The reconquest of the Sydøen;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.D;Our forces were paralysed by the declaration of the seditious Sydøer, but we have rallied and drafted several plans to retake the archipelago. We must be careful since the insurgents have contacted the powers of the New-World which might have declared their support of the new 'Republic'.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.A;Weigh, me boys, to Sydoe !;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ15.B;We better not ...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ16.T;Suðurhafseyjar;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFJ16.D;Published in $YEAR$, the book 'The South Sea Islands' from Hans Johannesson was soon recognized as a monument of Icelandic litterature, and following his translation of the whole Scandinavian literature. Inspired by the life of the author who himself lived several years in the colony of Sydøen, the book describes the travels of a poor Icelandic, Sigurd Hansson. Following the deaths of his mother and sister he is forced to leave his homeland because of the misery he lives in. Arriving in Righavn he relates the beauty of this exotic land, only to witness the darker side of the Sydøen society : while slavery is abolished, the narrator witnesses the violence of the old masters on their freed workers and how Afro-Kiskøyener are only second-class citizens in the islands. Eventually the story ends on a note of hope, the Icelandic finding happiness after settling in a small village of the Kiskøyene interior with his wife. While praised for its literary quality by the various literary critics of Copenhagen and beyond, the book was also vividly criticized by Kiskøyener for his critics of their society along with the end chapter implying that the narrator marries a Black woman. Nonetheless, the attention the book received made the Synoe colony widely known as the 'Suðurhafseyjar' in the rest of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

savoie_at_fuck_italy_desc;While Savoy has been under Italian rule for centuries, that does not negate the fact that the francophone Romand people exist as the majority inhabitants of the region. Thus, Savoy is much closer culturally to the Burgundian sphere than it is to the Italian sphere, giving us justification to take the territory. As the Italian peninsula is still recovering from the chaos that accompanied unification, we can seize this opportunity to press our claims on Savoy.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TUS1.T;The Buonaparte Insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS1.D;The proclamation of the duchy of Genoa by the former Doge Lodovico Della Rovere was not accepted by all in the Republic. Troubles brewed in Corsica for the past years, the island being notoriously hard to administer for the Ligurians. Eventually, the chief of the garrison of the island, Pietro Buonaparte declared that the Duke was an usurpator and that no Corsican would bow to the whims of a monarch. Without a fight, the various soldiers scattered around the island surrendered as Buonaparte was proclaimed Dictator of the Corsican Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS1.A;A rebellious island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.T;The Republican threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.D;The coup of Lodovico della Rovere saw the ending of the Genoan republic that had existed for centuries and was done thanks to his grip over the army. But lately his autocratic rule has alienated him several officers and throughout Liguria many resent him from the lowest classes to the old patricians who dream of restoring the Superba. With the Buonaparte insurrection in Corsica, some officers feel that the moment to restore the Republic has come. But the Duke still has some supports and is well prepared to face his opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.A;The rebellion is crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS2.B;Lodovico I flees the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.T;Savoy and Genoa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS3.D;The former duke of Genoa, Lodovico I Della Rovere has settled in Turin with his spouse Maria of Savoy, sister of our Duke Vittorio Filiberto. He shows little signs of wanting to fight for his former title. For the court of our Duke, it is a wonderful opportunity : Savoy has wanted to expand into Liguria for centuries, and Lodovico could be persuaded to renounce to his claims in favor of our Duke who could then rightfully restore order to these seditious Republicans. The price would not be cheap, as Della Rovere is known for his extravagant -and costly- lifestyle, and could severely hamper the finances of the state in the coming years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

TUS4.D;Overthrowing the tyran Della Rovere did not bring a peaceful restoration of the old order. Patricians squabbled among themselves for political positions while the Duke of Savoy gathered armies on the border. But in the end all was resolved when the Dictator of Corsica, Pietro Buonaparte accepted the office of Doge and brought back the island into the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS4.A;La Superba will endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.T;The matter of Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.D;Politics of Etruria have been growing more and more polarized after the revolutionary support for the short-lived Sicilian Republic ended in failure. Conservatives have taken back the upper hand in the legislature and government but Liberals still exert a vast influence. With the Corsican revolt ending the tyranny of Lodovico Della Rovere, many Republicans hoped that he would grant more liberties to the Corsican people. But eventually, Buonaparte ended ruling with an iron fist over the island, while members of the Society of the Commons were declared bandits and outlaws. Now the Republic must decide to either support the 'Protector of Corsica' who is still an ardent Republican, or support the underground factions of the Commons. His rule is far from assured and a few weapons and official support could easily lead to a popular uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.A;Stability is paramount : support Buonaparte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS5.B;A republic without freedom means nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.T;The deposition of Buonaparte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.D;After months of local infighting between the supporters of Buonaparte and the popular movements, Etruria finally offered her support to the Commons. A Tuscan ship boarded the Eastern Coast, supplying Antonio Paoli, former officer under Buonaparte, weapons to act. His partisans crossed the maquis and finally arrived in Corte where Buonaparte had established his government. The fighting was swift as partisans attacked the city from all sides, with Buonaparte surrendering mere minutes after the beginning of the attack. The manifesto of the Commons was soon printed en masse and shared throughout the island with the various villages and families of Corsica rejoicing over the new state of affairs. The first action of the Paoli government was to proclaim an alliance with Etruria and vowing to help in the overthrow of the Old order in Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS6.A;Viva Corsica!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.T;Revolution in Corsica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.D;Following the official support of the Etrurian republic for the Commons in Corsica, weapons were given to the leader of the resistance Antonio Paoli who then took nearly without any blood spilled the city of Corte where the government was hosted. A democratic Republic has been established in Corsica and Buonaparte will face a trial for his crimes agains the people. Paoli has pledged to support us in any endeavours we may face against the Reactionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS7.A;Now Corsica, soon all of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.T;The election of 1838;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.D;The Etrurian Republic has been experimenting a Byzantine system of government whose all goal is to prevent the rise of either Reactionaries or Radical Revolutionaries to power. The Republic is ruled through Councils that choose various the ministers and consuls of the Republic. Among the various councils the most important is the 200 Council, which is partially elected every 3 years, with one third of the seats to be filled in the coming election. The current legislature is divided, and despite the censitary vote in effect, the Republicans have a great chance at gaining a large majority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS8.A;Who will win ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.T;A very contested election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.D;After the votes were counted the 200 Council saw a Moderate majority seated. Among the members of the Society of the Commons, rumors spread of a plot to extinguish the Revolutionary flame once and for all by confiscating the election. The people was soon in arms in Florence, while soldiers were divided on how to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.A;The people end the Moderate governement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS9.B;The army sides with the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.T;A very contested election;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.D;The Republicans ended up winning the election, notably thanks to the vote of the soldiers, exempted from having to require to pay taxes to vote. But the Moderate Consuls did not intent to let the Republicans take power in the Republic. They soon called upon the army to storm the Parliament and arrest Republicans. Street fights were undecisive as many soldiers preferred to side with the popular movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.A;The Moderates restore Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS10.B;The Republicans crush the coup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
VAL1.T;The restoration of order in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VAL1.D;The republic of Etruria is a threat to the Italian Order. While Aragon is reluctant to go to war against them, we haven't forgotten our rights to the grand duchy of Tuscany. Medicis have ruled the city of Florence for 4 centuries and it is time we renew with this tradition. The various monarchs of North Italy would not react to this declaration because we would erase a threat to their personal power. It would be a perfect occasion as the Republic is currenty divided and the rebels squabbling among themselves. What do we choose ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
110601.A;Nous reprendrons nos droits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
110601.B;Le risque est trop grand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUS11.T;A stable Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS11.D;The Revolution has now ended. For too many years, Liberals and secret societies seeked to embroil Etruria once again in war against our Holy Faith and the various monarchs of the peninsula. While it is true that overthrowing the Old Order was justified we must take a diplomatic stance rather than risk a war we cannot win. Etruria will thus abandon the violence of the past years but not the Italian ideal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS11.A;Nessuna rivoluzione ma nessun Antico Regime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.T;A revolutionary Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.D;The Revolution has been hampered for too many years by the Moderate efforts to acquire 'normalized relations' with the reactionary states that surround us which only paved the way for the Provencal attempt to restore the Antico Regime. The people has been heard, and the Etrurian Republic will not stop until all Italy is liberated from its oppresive monarchs and foreign tyrans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS12.A;Unione Forza e Liberta!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

TUS13.B;What could we do with Corsica ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.T;Reclaiming Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.D;The duchy of Lucca is an artificial construction of the partisans of the Antico Regime. Following the peace of Lucca of 1814 the Gonzaga of Milan organized the creation of a monarchist state in Lucca and also encompassing the former duchy of Massa with Jean of Valois-Forcalquier, cousin of the King in France, proclaimed monarch of this petty state. His daughter Marguerite who succeeded him in 1827 enjoys little sympathy from the population and it will not be hard for our armies to bring back the Revolution to these territories:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS14.A;Lucca is Etrurian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.T;Ending the Farnese;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.D;Following the foolish attempt of Alessandro IV of Parma to establish a Constitutional Kingdom of Italy in the 1820's, his domains were split between his cousins Alessandro V in Parma and Ferdinando in Modena. Both claim the duchy of Massa from Lucca and have sent demands of aid to all the other monarchs in Italy, or so our spy networks tell us. We must end these petty duchies and united the people of Emilia in our Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS15.A;Onwards to Parma and Modena!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.T;The Romagnol uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.D;Romagna was the second centre of Revolution in Italy following Florence. Under the harsh conditions imposed by Papal reign, the students of Bologna had radicalized and joined arms with their brothers in Tuscany. But eventually, the order came back to Romagna and the Pope sent his protégé Gregorio Castiglione as special legate. Under his rule, the Papal Inquisition tracked the revolutionaries and expelled many professors from the oldest university of Europe. After his accession to the Papacy as Stephen X, his policies did not change and Romagna suffered cruel decades. But with our brothers in Tuscany having rekindled the flame of liberty, secret societies in Bologna have risen the tricolor and the Papal officials were forced to flee as the revolutionaries decided to join with Etruria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS16.A;Italia unita !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.T;Romagna joins us !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.D;Our success in Italy and our support for revolutionaries has rekindled the revolutionary fervour in Romagna. From the Liberal bastion of Bologna, where many of our leaders have been formed, the Patriots rose against the Papal garrison and agents who were thrown out. Then the Bologna assembly decided to join back Etruria to advance the National and Revolutionary cause. While an interesting prospect for us, it also enraged the Papacy who consider that we have invaded their territory. We might soon hear from Aragonese threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS17.A;Viva Romagna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.T;Loss of Romagna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.D;Romagna has risen against our power and pledged itself to the heathen radicals of Etruria. Always a hotbed of radicalism and agitation, it seems our rule through the use of the Inquisition alienated the good people of Romagna. The Papal army is weak, and Etruria has engineered many plots over the years so the Curia is weary of trying to fight them. We will wait for our Aragonese protectors to help us in that matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS18.A;The Church has endured for centuries, we can endure such a loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.T;Commons in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.D;Memories from the 1827 and 1828 uprising that saw the creation of the Neapolitan and Sicilian Republics are still vividly remembered in our Republic along with the restoration of order that followed by the tyrannous Catalans. All revolutionaries know it : the main menace for the Republic comes from Barcelona for it is because of Barcelona that the Pope still reigns with an iron fist over Central Italy. With our success in restoring Republican rule over Central Italy, the networks of the Commons Societies in Southern Italy have gathered again. We could begin help them organize so that they would rise should Aragon decide to try to end the Revolution. However such a move would be hard to hide from Catalan spies and could give further reasons to the Catalans to attack us ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.A;Il suon d'ogni squilla i Vespri suonò!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS19.B;We have learnt from 1828, leave the Southern peasants on their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.T;The second Italian Coalition war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.D;As many aristocrats and conservatives flock into Naples, we are forced to admit that the old Revolutionary threat in Tuscany has grown again and threatens our hegemony. We must gather our forces and restore order to Northern Italy lest we see the Green-White-Red tricolour fly over Rome, Naples and Palermo! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.A;God is with us in this holy war !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS20.B;We cant risk our holdings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.T;The Second Parthonepean Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.D;Our attack against Tuscany has rallied the unruly crowds of Napoli who have risen once again against our rule. Hopefully their rule does not extend over the whole South given their opposition to Santamarians, but they can still pose a threat to our current war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS21.A;End this petty Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.T;The Napolitan and Sicilian uprisings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.D;Etrurian agents had been plotting against us for years and they had sent agents to Napoli and Sicily to create a network of informants and rebels they could arm should we go to war with them. With our armies rallied to fight the Tuscan insurgents in the North, the Italian tricolour was flown over the citadel of Naples and much of Sicily, the revolutionaries hoping to win their freedom. Hopefully, we can squash these revolts again and teach the Southerners that Order is paramount;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS22.A;We will win !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.T;Proposal of a Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.D;A proposal has come from the Republic of Etruria. Having abandoned their revolutionary heritage for reason, they have proposed a peaceful unification of the Peninsula in a weak confederation that would be headed by the Pope while preserving the rights of all members and its own laws. This could be an interesting proposal to end the bickering between Italian statelets and avoid a forceful unification like dreamed about by the Savoyards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.A;This is a very interesting proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.B;We are better off alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS23.C;This is a very interesting proposal (Switch to Tuscany);;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.T;Formation of the Italian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.D;Italian nationalism has never really gone away despite the end of Revolution in Italy. As threats grow, the Pope, the Republic of Tuscany and Milano have decided to join in a Confederation that will be headed by his Holiness. The rights of all states adhering to the Confederation will be respected, with the Confederal government only in charge of war, trade and diplomacy. This Confederation is already very criticized, notably in Savoy who has been a prime opponent of the project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS24.A;One Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS25.T;Failure of the Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS25.D;The Council we had assembled to create a new Italian Confederation ended after the refusal of several members to join;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS25.A;It was just a dream after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.T;Crossing the Po;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.D;The Etrurian hydra roars again. Terrorists strike in all Italy while the barbarous legions of Florence have exiled the Farnese from their duchies. Leopoldo I stands ready to end the Etrurian menace once again as he did in his youths when hordes of peasants and atheists had taken the ancestral seat of his family in Mantua, and end once and for all the threat they pose to the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.A;Florence will be freed from barbary!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS26.B;Crossing the river would be foolish : watch the border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS27.T;Milanese attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS27.D;The Milanese Duke has decided to attack us, citing various grievances, notably the annexation of his cousins duchies in Emilia. His goal is nothing less than walking over Florence and end the Revolution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS27.A;To Arms Citizens !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS28.T;The Transpadan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS28.D;Our forces have vanquished the Gonzaga duke, who is now in exile in Germany. Our forces secured the help of local revolutionaries who have been put in charge of the new Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS28.A;With this, the Revolution grows stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.T;The Borgia charter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.D;Following the victory over the Republic of Etruria, Duke Leopoldo was approached by his daughter-in-law Maria Borgia. She exposed that Italy could not continue to be divided into petty states. Milan having defeated Etruria was the prime pretender to the defunct Kingdom of Italy and it could only come if a Charter was drafted to ensure stability and lessen the threat of the Republicans. By abdicating, Leopoldo, already aged, could secure a swift succession that could realize this idea and fight for the rights of Maria to Southern Italy. But he could also hold onto power and try to unite Northern Italy in a neutral confederation with the Pope, as suggested by Neo-Guelphists...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.A;An Italian confederation will preserve stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS29.B;The Charter is the first step to a unified Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.T;Marianist insurrection in Naples!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.D;Following the promulgation of the so-called 'Borgia Charter' by the Duke of Milan, Maria Borgia headed to Naples to claim her lost crown. Supported by Marianist networks, the garrison was soon overwhelmed and she could enter the city with minimal resistance. With the fall of the city, the countryside followed as many lords changed allegiances and peasants joined the Marianist banditry. War will come soon to the Boot of Italy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS30.A;If one abdication is not enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.T;The March on Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.D;The South has heard the call of her rightful sovereign as crowds gather to be armed and fight the Aragonese throughout the Kingdom of Naples. Between our current possessions and the South lie the prize of Italy, Rome still governed by the Church. The Pope has refused to grant us access, stating that Maria had no rights to Naples since her abdication. We have no choice but to declare war on the Papal State to make sure that the Marianists are not isolated in this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS31.A;If we can take Rome in the process ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.T;The unification of Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.D;When Maria Borja, queen of Aragon was deposed by Josep Serna in 1835 no one thought that she could become Queen again. The masses of the South rose to her call to fight Aragon. After a successful march on Rome she joined the armies of her husband Massimiliano Maria Visconti and managed to force Aragon to recognize her as the legitimate sovereign of Naples. With their victory over Etruria and the Aragonese, Massimiliano and Maria were eventually proclaimed the rightful sovereigns of Italy, despite the Pope, a mere puppet of Barcelona, refusing to accept this new order. Challenges await the Visconti-Borgia as Italy is yet to be completely united but crowds rejoice, for it has been centuries since the end of the Kingdom of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS32.A;Viva Massimiliano! Viva Maria ! Viva Italia ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.T;La Regina Margot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.D;The first representation of the new play of Dominico Rezzi, 'La Regina Margherita' was met with great acclaim in Milan. It retells the story of the Great Italian War (1539-1546) originating in the succession of Margherita I de Valois on the throne of Milan. Breaking with the classical rules, the play mixes tragical elements with grotesque scenes. The author notably represented the death of Francesco de Valois, duke of Milan during the Italian Wars, in an undignified manner that was criticized by many critics. The success of the play can be partially explained by the nationalist subtext : Margherita, the duchess of Milan must choose between a Borja and a Plantagenet to marry and her eventual wedding to the Dauphin is seen as the lesser of two evils both for her and for Italy. After a dozen of representations the play  was censored in the Duchy, the Duke consedering it a criticism of the future-Duchess Maria Borgia, .;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS33.A;A shame our Duke dislikes good theatre...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.T;The Republican Mother;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.D;Following a commission and gifts from all parts of the Republic, a new monument was unveiled in Florence. A statue was erected in honor of the Republican heroes Goffredo Baccarani and his wife Mariana Angeliotti. Baccarani secured the existence of the Republic in its first years and nearly managed to unify Northern Italy until he was shot in the leg and forced to retreat from the battlefields. His wife ruled the Republic in his absence through a network of yesmen allowing her to overcome the fact that women were not allowed to exercize charges. Even after the Moderate takeover of the Republic, Mariana continued to head the popular movements until she was shot by a priest in 1821. An immense crowd gathered to pay their respects to the Father and especially the Mother of the Republic, who now watch over the city from the hill of the Oltrarno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
TUS34.A;Statues to honor Republicans not Tyrans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.T;The Crown of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.D;The beginning of the XIXth century has been hard for the old crown of Aragon. After the incompetence and corruption of the reign of Ferran VI Borja, which saw the Aragonese nearly lose their Italian possessions because of the Etrurian revolution and the Santamarian insurrections in Naples, his brother and heir Ferran VI, died after only 44 days of rule. His daughter Maria was cast aside by the legitimized bastard of Joan IV, Josep of Serna who now rules the Crown and its various territories. Numerous challenges await the monarch : North Africa is far from being pacified with a rebellion of Berber tribes spilling over the Aragonese settlements. Italy remains a divided mess : our Sicilian holdings are plagued by banditry and plotters while the Etrurian republic still lives although the most revolutionary factions are inactive, for now. Both Burgundy and the Dual-Monarchy influence the Northern princes and among them, Milan may especially prove troublesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA1.A;Sempre endavant mai morirem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.T;The escape of Maria Borja;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.D;Following her deposition by the Cortes General and the annulation of her betrothal to the duke of Milan, Maria Borja has lived under house arrest on the island of Capri in the bay of Naples. While posing a threat to Josep Serna because of her legitimacy, she was always seen as easily manipulated and not worth much surveillance. In these conditions, the news of her escape as a great surprise to the Aragonese government. In the night of the 25th February 1837, she boarded a Genoan ship bought by the duke of Milan and she arrived in Genoa before any Aragonese ships could arrest her and from there joined Massimiliano Maria, heir of Leopoldo I in Milan where they were wed in great pomp. So far Maria has announced that she will not renegate her abdication and that she had formally renounced her claim to the Kingdom of Aragon but many legitimists gather throughout the Crown calling for the return of the 'Queen in Milan'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA2.A;Who would have thought that a former Queen would flee her little island ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.T;Maria Borgia, future duchess of Milan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.D;Maria of Aragon had been promised to the son of Leopoldo I, the prince of Legnano, in the hopes of uniting peacefully Italy. However the usurpation of Josep Serna ended these hopes, with the former queen sent under house arrest in the island of Capri. Despite the betrothal officially broken by the Cortes-General, Massimiliano never abandoned his fiancée and planned for her escape. Abord a Genoese ship bought by the Duke, Maria fled and finally arrived in Milan where the two were married by the archbishop. While formally accepting her abdication of the crown of Aragon, as to not provoke more Serna and upset the status quo, the ducal couple has in private swore to retake their Italians possessions from the Catalans who wronged them. Already several legitimist nobles from Naples and Sicily, so-called 'Borjists' have come to Milan to meet with their pretender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ARA3.A;Maria will become Queen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.T;The House of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.D;The house of Savoy is one of the mightiest houses of Italy. Ever since the XVIIth century, our power has grown in Italy proper while our Transalpine possessions becoming more of an afterthought. The conquest of Monferrato and Novara from the Duchy of Milan in the late XVIIIth century saw us put firmly in the Anglois sphere. To many in Turin it appears that we could leverage our Western possessions against military help to form a united Italy. At least, we will not bow down so easily to other would-be unifiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR1.A;FERT!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.T;Our chance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.D;The call to unity from Maria Borgia and the current war against Aragon appear to many officials as the perfect opportunity for our state to gain ascendency. But at the same time, this would alienate our friends in Paris which are still interested in our Savoyard possessions and we would be alone in this war. Let us backstab our rivals in Milan and become the true unifiers of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.A;To Milan and more !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR2.B;Now is not the right time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.T;Ending the Revolutionary threat ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.D;The Etrurian republic which has been the greatest threat to stability and tradition in Italy in the recent past is now at war with the Aragonese Crown. We cant let either win : Etruria securing its independence would inspire revolutionaries everywhere in Italy while Aragon restoring order would just hamper our claims to the old Kingdom of Italy. We must thus cross the border and attack the so called heart of the Revolution and bring glory and unity to the peninsula. But at the same time, this would alienate us our friends in Paris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.A;We will end the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR3.B;Let them fight, we can pick up the scraps;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.T;The isolation of Piedmont;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.D;Turin has profited from the current state of war between us and Central Italy to backstab our enemies and proclaim that they are the only worthy unifier of Italy. While it will make our war easier, we must profit from the opportunity to bring Piedmont under our domination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR4.A;The house of Savoy must end;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR6.D;With our influence secured in Savoy, our state can easily obtain their western territories on our side of the Alps in exchange for support in creating an Italian state.

SAR8.T;The threat from the West;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.D;With the house of Savoy under threat from invaders from beyond the Alps, the political climate in the Italian confederation has drastically changed. With their rivals from Turin not able to deny their legitimacy and the threat caused by the invasion, the Italian confederation has declared itself the rightful Italian state and has received the support of most of the Italian patriots in doing so. The squabbles between the various members have also been put aside, creating a federal government with far more prerogatives than the old Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR8.A;Avanti Italy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$s proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.D;$ FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials have proposed us their help in the unification of Italy under our state in exchange for the promise of our Savoyard possessions. It is true that our state was created in the Alpine valleys and that the royal house is known as the house of Savoy. But these are rural and enclaved lands, and not many want to keep them when we can easily trade them for the whole peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR9.A;If they honor the deal, we will give them Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR11.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.D;Following agreements between the house of Savoy and $FROMCOUNTRY$, the government of $COUNTRY$ has declared war on the weak Italian confederation, proclaiming that Italy needs a strong and united government rather than the mess that the Compromesso created. It is a war opposing Italian against Italian, with the support of foreigners, and whatever the end, it will change Italy forever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR11.A;Let us hope for the better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.T;A Geographical Construct;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.D;Italy has been united by $FROMCOUNTRY$. A weak puppet state only controlling Northern Italy, not even Rome, this new state has already been heavily criticized by the Italian patriots who see it only as the result of another foreign imperialist. While it appeared to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government as the best option to stabilize Italy, this may lead to a renewed era of instability from the various groups.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR12.A;At least there is an Italy I guess ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.T;Il Compromesso;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.D;The Italian Confederation is a loose compromise between the various powers of Central Italy. It satisfies no one, and few people consider it the rightful Italian state. Unless the state can assert itself in the coming years, it may easily fall to infighting and instability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR13.A;We will unite Italy nonetheless !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.T;Thirty-Two years of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR14.D;The Confederation has endured over the years but mostly out of luck rather than efficiency. It is still a mess, and hardly anyone in Italy recognize our authority as rightful.

SAR17.T;The new Savoyard government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.D;The house of Savoy had bided its time but they have successfully managed to take control of the Confederation by appointing their chosen government with the help of many Italian nationalists and various opponents inside the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR17.A;What does this entail?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.T;The Council of the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.D;The various officials of the Italian states who are members of the Confederation have gathered in $THISCAPITAL$ to discuss the future of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR18.A;The dice is cast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.T;A Stable Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.D;While many thought that the Confederation was living its last hours, temperance has prevailed in the Council, as all its members recognized that they were better in this Confederation than independent and only to be prey to the Aragonese and Piedmontese. Thus endures the Confederation, and maybe one day, it will be the legitimate Italian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR19.A;Long live the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.T;Collapse of the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.D;The compromise that created the Italian confederation has failed to endure. The various members of this polity decided to dissolve the state and go their separate ways following decades of political inertia and divisions. Italy becomes fractured again, and no one knows who will profit from this return to the old times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR20.A;Damn the divisions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.T;The Unification of Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.D;Following the appointment of the Piedmontese grand-duke as head of the Confederation, many feared that the Aragonese would try to disrupt the new power in the North. But unable to intervene, this has left the Savoyards to cement their rule of the Confederation and finally proclaim a united Italian Kingdom under their helm. Now Italy exists, and not just as a weak state unable to resolve disputes between the various interests groups that composed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR21.A;Avanti Italia !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.T;Savoyard Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.D;A weak Italian Confederation served our interests well since it allowed us to play the various members of this state one against another. But the pesky Savoyards have appointed their own government following the recent political instability in the Confederation, and if we dont act soon they could easily proclaim a united Italy. Our best chance is to secure Rome and the Pope swiftly and deal with the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.A;Rome must be protected !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR22.B;We are not strong enough to face the Savoyards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.T;The Italian Liberation War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.D;Aragonese troops walked into Rome following the announcement of the reorganization of the Confederation under the house of Savoy. This is an outrage to all Italian patriots and it has strengthened our rule. But we must march south unless we want Italy to still be disunited!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.A;To Rome !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR23.B;The Confederation is fine without the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.T;Victory of the House of Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.D;The mobilized forces of the reorganized Italian confederation have liberated Rome from Aragonese occupation. Following this tremendous success, the Grand-Duke of Piedmont was officially crowned King of Italy and abolished the former Confederation. A new power has emerged on the European scene, and soon Italy will surely be completely independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR24.A;FERT !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.T;Victory of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.D;The Italian Confederation could not vanquish our forces in Rome, leaving us in control of the old city, the Pope and crushing any hope the Savoyards entertained about using the Confederation as a tool for their ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR25.A;Our ambitions are intact !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR26.A;A good conclusion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR27.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR27.D;Backed by foreign interests, Piedmont has declared war on the Italian Confederation. Should they win, they will not stop at just Northern Italy, already planning for the conquest of our southern holdings. Now is the time for action and war against the Confederation to carve the North before Savoyards take it. Although that also means that we could end up facing the Great Power that protects and helps them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR27.B;We cant risk it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
SAR28.T;Aragonese intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

SAR31.T;The Burgundian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SAR31.D;Taking advantage of our disorder following our unification of the Italian peninsula, an envoy from Burgundy has come to press their claims on the region of Savoy. While the region has been under Italian rule for centuries the population itself is of mixed stock, with the francophone Romand comprising a slight majority. Based on this majority, the Burgundians seem insistent on claiming the territory, with the Burgundian envoy hinting at war were we to refuse their claims. As Savoy has been a part of an Italian state for centuries, nationalists have called upon us to defend the territory against Burgundian aggression. On the other hand, the Romand majority that inhabits Savoy is culturally much closer to the Burgundians than the Italians, and to reject their demands would mean perpetual enmity between ourselves and the Burgundians. How shall we respond?;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SAR31.A;We shall recognize their claims. Savoy belongs to Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SAR31.B;Italy stands united! It will not be chipped away be foreign actors!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SAR120.T;The Treaty of Lyon;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SAR120.D;We have signed a treaty with the House of Savoy to obtain the disputed territory of Savoie in the aftermath of diplomatic discussions in the city of Lyon. For this formerly disputed territory- we will assist their efforts in unifying Italy under their banner and ensure that they are defended against any potential retaliation from Aragon upon the conclusion of this unification.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the Crimeans also impose an difficult obstacle on our policymakers: access to the Black Sea. With the Crimean peninsula serving as the khanates heartland, it is difficult for our state to truly utilize the Black Sea for our benefit. With the downfall of the Crimeans, Russia will further its goals in the quest for dominance in the South!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  
the_dreams_of_cossacks_title;The dreams of the Cossacks;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_dreams_of_cossacks_desc;The Cossacks have long dreamt of reaching the Caspian sea, riding eastwards and establishing new hosts. Due to over extension this dream has never bore fruit. But it may now, as Russian eastward expansion may allow the Cossacks to move and settle under our administration, forming regional clans in newly conquered areas, and helping to keep order among the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   
demolish_cirassia_title;Demolish Circassia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
demolish_cirassia_desc;Circassia stands on the edge of the Caucasus Mountains, one last foe before we reach the magnificent frontier. We cleaved through the Cossacks, Tatars and Turks, the Circassians will not be any different, for Russias destiny lays on the snowy mountaintops of the harsh Caucasus Mountains.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   
triumph_in_the_south_title;Triumph in the South;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
triumph_in_the_south_desc;The South has been tamed. No hordes, no hosts, and no khanates, only Russias might dominate these lands. Both our physical frontier is secured in the mountainous south, as well as our naval backyard on the rocky shores of the Crimean coast. Russia has broken the Turkic grip that held it down for centuries, and has brought security to its periphery.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clean_up_ingria_desc;Without their Scandinavian overlord, the watchdogs of the East have lost their bite. After the untimely departure of Scandinavia, the lands that are indisputably Russian may finally be cleaned up and brought back into their Russian kin. This may also help us secure our much needed claim on the Baltic Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_livonian_war_title;The Livonian War;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_livonian_war_desc;Livonia has been in Scandinavian hands for over a millennium. But can they really back their claim to these lands anymore? As Russia awoke from its millennium long slumber, Livonia is shaken from its flimsy Scandinavian shackles, to be brought into Russia. This territory establishes a true foothold on the Baltic coast, and as such must be acquired by our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
secure_russian_karelia_title;Secure Russian Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
secure_russian_karelia_desc;Karelia has been strongly tied with Novgorod for centuries, this is obviously well known. Its current owners, however, have maintained their hold over the region not by their strength, but by our weakness. Such weakness is no longer present, and we will show the northmen that legitimacy can only be earned by the sword!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_scandinavian_folly_title;The Scandinavian folly;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
the_scandinavian_folly_desc;Scandinavia is effectively an overseas power, and the reason for this is the cold and barren Finland. Finland is the wall Scandinavia cowers behind when it so cowardly threatens Russia. But this wall can be turned against the petty Scandinavians, for with ease we could conquer Finland and establish our own dominion over it, stripping the northmen of their last imperial possession in the East.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
triumph_in_the_north_title;Triumph in the North;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
triumph_in_the_north_desc;Scandinavia has been dismantled, and has limped away across the Baltic Sea to their frigid home. Now the Baltics, Karelia, and Finland are under Russian authority, as we went from holding a barely functional White Sea port, to the grand Baltic shore. From the Gulf of Finland to the gulf of Riga, we may now enjoy the prosperity of Baltic trade. But our victories dont end there, with Baltic trade comes access to the West, as the only thing that separates our state from the ones of Central and Western Europes is a short boat trip. With the conquest of the North comes the embrace of the West!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_sibir_title;Integrate Sibir;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
integrate_sibir_desc;Sibir has stared at us across Siberia for centuries, out of our reach. Now we leaped across Eurasia, establishing footholds all over Siberia. The Khanate of Sibir is one of our footholds in the region, influenced by cunning diplomacy and our economic power. Now we may use that leverage to establish a protectorate over the khanate and integrate it into the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_kazan_title;Integrate Kazan;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
integrate_kazan_desc;Kazan has been an awkward interloper in Russian affairs, exploiting our division to pillage and enslave our people. Kazans presence has slowly shrunk over the years as Russia has coalesced into a powerful nation, and now poses no threat to our security. But Russian interests in the region demand action, Kazan is still in our way eastwards, and its rivers will prove useful for our economy. Now that Kazan has been declawed, we may be able to force it into our empire diplomatically, turning it into a mere protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
integrate_bashkir_title;Integrate Bashkir;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
integrate_bashkir_desc;Bashkir lays in the middle of the Ural Mountains, the Caspian Sea, and the Aral Sea. A symbolic gateway eastwards, wherefrom we may not only ride eastwards, but also southwards to the lands of Persia and India. Like the rest of the petty khanates, economic and military pressure might prove to be an easier solution to direct military action, for we have gone a long way since the Russian nation has exploded outwards from its Slavic heartlands.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

move_capital_TVE_desc;The new Russian tsardom has secured its hold over Eastern Europe and gained access to the Baltic. While Tver, Yaroslavl and Vladimir are all important cities, the Tsar and the nation need a new capital city to show to the world the wonders Russia is capable of. Out of the swamps of the Neva in Nyenschantz, we will use the tremendous workforce of the freed serfs to build Belskaya, where soon our Belsky rulers will sit and decide the fate of the world!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

move_capital_RYA_desc;The port of Tanais has become a summer residence for many boyars along with members of the imperial family thanks to its proximity to the Black Sea. For many years the imperial government has entertained the idea of building a new Russian capital here, easily accessible to the sea and thus to international trade while symbolizing the new might of the Slavs over the Tatars. Let the old port transform itself into a city worthy of the old 'Gunpowder Prince' Alexander Repnin, Alexandrovsk!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_NZH_title;Volga Volga!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_NZH_desc;The Volga river is the main artery of trade and wealth in the new Russia, which has been born thanks to the opening of Tatar lands to colonization. The old city of Saraj was built on a strategic path, where the Don and Volga river get close enough to build a canal. Our government plans that around this vital canal a city would be built that will outshine the mosques and bazaars from the old Tatar 'city' and serve as the rightful capital of the nation!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

move_capital_NOV_desc;What other city could outshine Novgorod in Russia and serve as its capital? None. But as proud as everyone is of the oldest city of the East, it is admitted that the lack of urban planning and the uncertainties of the past years have led to a demand for renewed urban works. With this, the capital of Russia can shine and be recognized internationally as the greatest city of the world!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_SMO_title;Our heritage;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_SMO_desc;Kiev was the capital of the first state of Rus' and is thus the natural choice of capital for our Slavic union, but at the same time the city has seen better days. The Polish treated it as the last city before the frontier and generally left no trace of their passage outside of the Catholic churches. We will rebuild it as a vibrant and mighty city like in the times of the Princes of Kiev, with an important focus on the Palace of the People that will host the Slavic Duma.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move_capital_CSK_title;The Eastern Capital;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
move_capital_CSK_desc;Kharkov has served as the natural seat of government for the unified hosts thanks to its central location in Ukraine. But as our state grows in the East the need for a new capital has become more pressing. Many call for the old city of Saraj to be planned as the new capital as we build a canal between the Don and the Volga rivers. The old slums and inadequate buildings will be swept away as the new city of Slavsjank becomes the symbol of the might of the Slavs over the Steppe people.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS1.T;The new Troubles;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1.D;The idea of a united Russia was born under the leadership of the Princes of Moscow in the XIVth and XVth century, but never realised after the fragmentation of the realm of Ivan III. As Princes betrayed and fought each other, foreign powers and their lapdogs in Novgorod and Moscow carved Russia. Yaroslav, Moscow and Ryazan all had their hour of glory but Tatar attacks, Polish and Scandinavian support for their enemies and pure incompetence led to an ever changing balance of power between the three principalities. Konstantin XI Belsky of Yaroslavl hopes to unify the Russians under his absolute rule to modernize the country. The Repnins of Ryazan must face a powerful boyar assembly who thrives on serfdom. Meanwhile, Nizhny Novgorod never had the power of the other contestants, though its links to the East and the confusing situation surrounding her Prince Alexey II may lead to an opportunity to get power. The status quo holds because of the Scandinavian and Polish networks in the area but with Poland and Scandinavia growing weaker it will soon break.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS2.T;The Principality of Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS2.D;In 1836, the Lyapunov principality of Moscow is the rising star of Central Russia. The country has recently celebrated a victory against Yaroslavl, the defection of a Smolensk noble confederation in Vyazma to Moscow, too distant for Warsaw to intervene. The current ruler, Peter III Lyapunov has been married to the daughter of Maximillian III Habsburg, ruler of the Commonwealth, under the auspices of the philo-polish boyars. Many saw this move as an unprofitable match with Europes sick man and Moscow is seen as a Polish lapdog to the rest of the Russians. In the meantime his sister Anna reigns in Nizhny Novgorod alongside her husband Alexey II. But troubles are brewing in all of Russia as the Republic of Novgorod crumbles under its contradictions while the various princes hope to vanquish us to reunify what Ivan III nearly achieved in the XVth century./nWarning: Moscow has the hardest time forming Russia since it only has access to the Form Russia decision since it is the status quo candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS2.A;S' nami Bog'!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.T;The Principality of Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS3.D;The Principality of Smolensk is the result of many contentions between Russian states and the Commonwealth. Since the peace treaty that ended the Yaroslavl-Polish War, Smolensk has been part of the Polish sphere of influence and in the last 40 years the title of Prince of Smolensk has been part of the long list of honorifics of the Polish king. The princedom is de facto ruled by a Governor, currently General Aleksander Kilinski, who has to wrestle authority with the local Duma controlled by boyar families and the archeparch. Smolensk has agitated for years against Poland, and the recent loss of its eastern territories to Moscow has cemented the idea among the population and the elites that the Polish yoke will have to be thrown out and Smolesnk must regain its independence. Smolensk is the Russian state that has been the most influenced by the West with works of the Enlightenment translated and discussed in the salons of the capital: should it seize the occasion and unite Russia, it will surely be a new era for Eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS4.D;The annexation of Smolensk by the Commonwealth led to the extension of Western habits in the Princedom. Smolensk is thus home to the first Russian-language University and has become one of the liveliest cultural centres of Eastern Europe, especially for literature and theatrical drama. In the halls of the university, students gather in various meetings and recent inquiries have shown the development of nationalist speeches in its halls. Governor Aleksander Kilinski decided to act by passing a law to bring the Smolensk university to the same standard as the rest of the Rzeczpospolita, namely making the usage of Polish language mandatory while restricting access to the Jewish and non-Uniate students. Of course it meant receiving the approval of the Duma which had vetoed most of his decisions in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.A;Smolensk will be taught Polish!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS4.B;The law is vetoed in the Duma.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.T;University protests;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.D;The Polish debate in the Duma was met with hostility by the student leaders and some professors who criticized both the Polonization policy of the Governor acting on the orders of Warsaw and the aristocratic Duma that clung to its privilege. Students poured into the streets brandishing a banner of gold, blue, and white that has become in the previous years a pan-Russian nationalist symbol. The demonstration nearly ended in a riot before the Smolenskian guards of Kilinski dispersed the students without shedding any blood. The day after, a new journal was born, 'Svoboda i Narodnost' (Freedom and Nation) whose director Michel Shafirov had become a public figure following a speech in the demonstration. It has become evident to many Polish administrators that Smolensk could erupt into revolt in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS5.A;Damn students!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.T;The Smolensk Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.D;Unrest had grown in the whole principality for months, with the newspaper 'Freedom and Nation' stirring up the various causes of discontent against Warsaw. Following the news of the death of the King of the Commonwealth, the various nationalist groups clamored for an end to Polish rule in Smolensk and demonstrations erupted in the capital. With students joined by the members of all classes of the city, Governor Kilinski was soon abandoned by his troops and forced to flee to Kaunas. The Duma was soon convened by the archeparch and the nobles were quick to use the events to proclaim Smolenskian independence. However the crowd led by Shafirov, soon entered the Duma demanding the abolition of serfdom. With the troops rallied to the insurgents, the archeparch soon proclaimed its end and called for the Duma to reconvene two weeks later to decide the future of Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS6.A;The revolution has freed the people!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.T;Ending the Regency.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.D;As the archeparch had proclaimed, the Duma reconvened to decide who shall rule the Principality. Adding to the traditional seats held by the boyars and the clergy, the cities had sent representatives for the first time in its history. In this new assembly the archeparch proposed for prince, the experienced Vasily Kropotkin, a descendant of the Rurikids. Meanwhile the aristocrats attempted to place one of their own, Stanislav Bagushevic, wary of the power of a prince supported by the archeparch. With the nobility split, it was to the new deputies to decide. Shafirov who represented Smolensk meanwhile advocated for the end of the princedom: Smolensk should be a confederation under the symbolic protection of the archeparch like in Kiev and most of all grant voting rights to all its population. He argued that liberating the serfs was meaningless without their participation in politics.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.A;Kropotkin ascends the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.B;The Duma chooses Bagushevic.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS7.C;The Republic is proclaimed!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS8.T;The White Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS8.D;Kilinski had been forced to flee, but he did not intend to let the revolutionaries win. Without any support of the Sejm in Warsaw he was forced to rely on the political networks and relations he had created while in office. He gained support in the Litvin provinces of the south who were wary of the plans for Russian national unification and had stronger ties with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His conspiracy would have succeeded if he had not been discovered crossing the border, and forced to flee back to Warsaw. Eventually the Smolenskian forces were able to disperse the Litvins in the south.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS8.A;We should watch the South closely.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He gained support in the Litvin provinces of the south who were wary of the plans for Russian national unification and had stronger ties with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His conspiracy reached Smolensk but was ultimately exposed by an officer who decided to side with the newly independent government of Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS9.A;Will we be free of this man?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.T;The White Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.D;Kilinski may have failed to take control of Smolensk but he soon find enough supporters in the Litvin provinces of the south who were wary of the promises of war made by the new government, and had stronger ties with the Commonwealth than with Russia. He has now proclaimed the secession of the southern provinces who hoist the Pahonia.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS10.A;Smolensk is indivisible!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.T;The Vyazma Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.D;A decade ago the boyars of our eastern provinces have left the principality, choosing the prince of Moscow as their new liege due to heavy taxation imposed by Kilinski. This was a blow to the already waning influence of the Commonwealth which could not lift a finger to avoid it, mostly because they had allied with Moscow against Scandinavia and Yaroslavl. With our independence secured many think it is time to reclaim our lost lands, secure the capital, and prepare ourselves for the fight to come. But many nobles are angered by the end of serfdom in Smolensk. These nobles refuse to aid in preparations for war, while the Duma is increasingly divided on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.A;War will come anyway, we must strike first!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS11.B;War is vetoed in the Duma;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.T;The Vozhd;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.D;The veto of war preparatives has paralysed the Duma, and the aristocracy clashed with the nationalists and liberals. Eventually the situation deteriorated to the point that a young officer, Commander Mikhail Tomylovic, left his barrack with his regiment and stormed the Duma. Unknown before, this officer that has risen from the ranks and whose parents were freed serfs, is now in charge of the destiny of the state. Tomylovic has proclaimed himself 'Vozhd' (the Leader of the People), has abolished the Duma, and finally arrested several boyars of high rank while forcing the archeparch to resign from his leadership role. Now the preparations begin for the oncoming war, for the Vozhd will not let Moscow bring shame to Smolesnk anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS12.A;A new leader for Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.T;The Smolensk embassy;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.D;Eventually the demands of the Smolenskian state were dispatched to the prince of Moscow: he was to cede back the unlawful territories he had usurped in the past decade or face war from Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS13.A;It is merely for diplomacy.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.T;Smolenskian declaration of war;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.D;We had extended our western border in 1829 following the secession of a league of nobles angered by taxation from the Polish administration of Smolensk. But now declaring independence, Smolensk comes after us in an attempt to reclaim these lands. Warsaw had not interved when Smolensk had declared its revolution, and they will not intervene now for such a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS14.A;We can defeat Smolensk easily!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS15.T;The declaration of war;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS15.D;It is time to retake back our lands from Moscow and free our brothers who still suffer under serfdom!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS15.A;Vyazma shall be ours again!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.T;Return of the Vyazman Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.D;Moscow has been crushed by our modern forces and we have retaken our lands in the east. It is a great victory for $COUNTRY$ and the first actions we have undertaken is to put to trial the boyars who seceded in 1829 while freeing the serfs from these provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS16.A;Smolensk is ascendant!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS17.T;Coup attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS17.D;Just as we have delivered a blow to our enemies in the west, weve also repelled our enemies in the east. The conniving general Alexander Kilinski has attempted to overthrow our government and the duma in order to drag Smolensk back into polish servitude. The coup naturally found no support from the people of Smolensk, and the army has quickly captured and detained the general and his litvin collaborators from Polotsk. Kilinski has already been executed for his crimes, and his supporters who did not flee to Poland wait in our prisons, and will surely meet a similar fate.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS17.A;The integrity of Smolensk has triumphed!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS18.T;Coup attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS18.D;A peculiar figure has briefly reemerged in Smolensk: the traitor Kilinski. He was surrounded by Litvins, who wished to return Smolensk to the authority of Warsaw. Kilinski and his supporters against leader Tomylovic and Smolensk were gunned down by our militia as they attempted to make their way through our great city. However, the leader was greatly agitated by this coup, and perceived the litvins in the west as perpetrators, and betrayers of the russian people. The leader of the people, Mikhail Tomylovic, has unleashed the army of Smolensk on the countryside, massacring litvins who are believed to be conspirators./n/nSmolensk is bloody and quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS18.A;Smolensk remains unshakeable!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS19.T;:Insurrection!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS19.D;Our forces, bloodied and beaten by the muscovite army, have been taken by surprise. General Kilinski has marched on Smolensk with the support of dissatisfied litvins in order to restore the authority of the polish crown! Our brave men have managed to repel the traitor, but were unable to capture or kill him. Kilinski has now fled to Polotsk, and began preparations for an active insurrection against the princedom. The details regarding his efforts are muddy, and we are not sure to what degree the former-governor has managed to whip up support among the litvins. Regardless of that, our army is preparing for an armed confrontation.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS19.A;Smolensk will NOT be torn to pieces!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.T;A free Polotsk;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.D;The prince of Smolensk has finally been driven out of Polotsk, and we have achieved freedom from the east. The militiamen of Polotsk roam its streets, safe and unmolested. Now that the future of Polotsk lays within our hands and not those of the Russian, we may decide our fate: we could attempt to join our kin in the grand duchy of Lithuania, or remain a sovereign and independent state.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.A;Let us unite with our people!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS20.B;Polotsk will remain free and strong!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS21.T;Polotsk secedes from Smolensk;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS21.D;To our surprise, the fledgling Polotsk insurgency has driven out the princely forces of Smolensk. The Polotsk insurgents first took arms to bring the whole of Smolensk back to our hands, but after failing their objective, they resorted to break free from the principality altogether. Now the small state has petitioned us for annexation into the grand duchy of Lithuania. Naturally, we see no problem with such an arrangement, but the Sejm does. The Sejm has shot down Polotsk's proposal with a veto, leaving our relationship in an awkward and uncertain state. The best we could do is wait for a better time.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS21.A;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS22.T;The Sejm refuses!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS22.D;The people of Polotsk are in shock as news from Warsaw has arrived: the polish Sejm has refused to admit our ascension into the grand duchy of Lithuania! Our government is uncertain about how to proceed, as we have fought tooth and nail against Smolensk for the unity of our people. The best we can hope for is a more favorable situation in Warsaw...;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS22.A;How could they do such a thing?!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS220.T;A Prince in Exile;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS220.D;When Stanislaw Habsburg was convicted as a traitor by the Sejm, he pondered his options. Austria may have been the seat of his house but the Polish branch had cut ties with Wien following the German wars and the rift had never been healed. Moreover it meant becoming a pawn in Bohemian hands, something Stanislaw could not accept. Thus he went to Moscow, joining his sister Maria, wed decades before to the prince Peter III Lyapunov. Over the years Stanislaw had proved himself a strong strategist, at least on paper, and a commander his men respected and looked up to. Now settled in the Kremlin, he has asked for a commandment to at least 'be useful' in his exile. Approved by the Prince, this move has been criticised by some members of the pro-Polish faction who fear that the Commonwealth may look towards Moscow once again.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS220.A;The Commonwealth is irrelevant.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS23.T;'The Green Prince';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS23.D;The succession of the Principality of Nizhny Novgorod is one of the great questions agitating central Russia. The current prince, Alexey, is the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife and cousin of the prince of Yaroslavl. Having produced no offspring despite his decade of marriage, both hope to inherit the principality. A pamphlet has begun circulating throughout Russia, mocking the frivolous habits of Alexey "the Green Prince" and his love for figurative and performing arts. Although no explicit claims were made, this pamphlet infers that the Prince is a homosexual and thus unfit to rule his city. Alexey is said to have wept at the circulation of 'The Green Prince' and decided to retire to his dacha in the countryside with his artistic court while leaving the affairs of state to his wife and counts Balakhnin and Varankin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS23.A;A strange affair...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.T;'The Green Prince';;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.D;The succession of the Princedom of Nizhny Novgorod is one of the great questions agitating central Russia. The current prince, Alexey, is both the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife and cousin of the prince of Yaroslav. Having produced no offspring despite having been married for a decade, both Moscow and Tver hope to inherit the Principality. A pamphlet has begun circulating throughout Russia, mocking the frivolous habits of Alexey "the Green Prince" and his love for theater and ballets. Although no explicit claims were made, this pamphlet infers that a Prince enjoying acting on stage among other 'foreign vices' is unfit to rule his city. Alexey is said to have been so angered at the circulation of 'The Green Prince' that he decided to retire to his dacha in the countryside with his artistic court while leaving the affairs of state to his wife Anna as the counts Kondraty Balakhnin and Grigory Varankin, both men known for their respective ties to Tver and Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS24.A;Retiring alone in his dacha will not give him an offspring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.T;A day in the countryside;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.D;Alexey II has been enjoying his sojourn at his hunting dacha, which was embellished by his father in order to make it as furnished as the palace in the city. Alexey has enlarged the estate, reserving an entire aisle for his theatrical endeavours. When Anna Lyapunova, his wife, came to the residency with General Temey Talantsev escorting her, the Prince was playing the main role of Orpheus, a melodrama by the Bohemian playwright, Ludwid Schubert. Following the ending of the play, the prince retired to his private quarter with his wife. No one knew what has occured during their exchange but the princess has decided to reside for an indefinite time in the dacha with her husband, leaving the affairs of state to the various factions of Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS25.A;What is the meaning of this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.T;An heir for Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, Prince Alexey has emerged to announce that his wife is pregnant with an heir. 2 years earlier, in order to relieve his melancholy caused by the attacks of politicians and the pressures of his natural family and in-law-family, Alexey had delegated all political affairs to Anna Lyapunova, with whom he had an undeniable close and affectionate relationship. This announcement at the end of a routine long stay of the princess at the dacha has shocked the Russian courts, many speculating that the presumptive heir would actually be a legitimised child of the Princess and her latest publicly known paramour. Yet after a slightly premature childbirth, healthy Mikhail Belsky was declared the natural son of the prince and princess and sole legitimate heir to Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS26.A;Long live Mikhail!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.T;Family news;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, the cousin of our prince, Alexey of Nizhny Novgorod has emerged back to Nizhny Novgorod to present his son Mikhail to the crowds. This is a surprise to many in Russia, as his wife, Anna of Moscow, had not visited him for a long time before her current stay in the countryside dacha of the prince and is suspected to entertain many paramours. Mikhail being a Belsky seems hard to believe, and we would have the right to denounce the child as illegitimate to claim the principality that was ours but a few decades ago. But should Moscow support the princess and recognize her offspring as legitimate, we might lose the influence we have in the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.A;Congratulate Alexey for the enlargement of the Belsky family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS27.B;Mikhail is a bastard and Anna a woman of little virtue!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS28.D;After two years of self-exile in his lavish dacha, the brother-in-law of our Prince, Alexey of Nizhny Novgorod, has emerged back in his capital to present his son Mikhail to the crowds. This is a surprise to many in Russia, as his wife, Anna of Moscow, had not visited him for a long time before her current stay in the countryside dacha of the prince and is suspected to entertain many paramours. The Moscow court was always wary of Anna who always appeared ambitious and full of vices for the devout circles in court. Mikhail being a Belsky seems hard to believe, and we could denounce the conduct of Anna Lyapunova. But should Yaroslavl support the princess and recognize her offspring legitimate, we might lose the influence we have in the ourt of Nizhny Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.A;Congratulate Anna for her child!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS28.B;Anna has dishonored the Lyapunov family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.T;Denunciation  of the heir;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS29.D;The prince of Moscow has refused to recognize our heir as legitimate, denouncing the shameful conduct of the princess, and accusing her of using another man to cover for the 'foreign vices' of her husband. Count Kondraty Balakhnin, the leader of the pro-Yaroslavl faction in the court has joined the prince in the palace to suggest to him the dissolution of the Duma and to purge the Muscovite plotters that held power in it, with the support of Yaroslavl of course. Meanwhile the princess warned him of the influence of the Yaroslavl faction that could use the purge of the Duma to ensure their own power in the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS30.T;A letter to Yaroslavl;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS30.D;The plots of the Yaroslavl faction have born fruit. Following the recent events at the Court and in the Duma, Count Balakhnin has secured power and put the princely family under surveillance in their palace to avoid the various assassination plots that had sprung in the previous weeks. Exchanges of letters between Nizhny Novgorod and the court of Yaroslav are seen daily as the Count prepares for the reunification of the Belsky familial lands. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS31.T;A letter from Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.D;Our man in Nizhny Novgorod, the Count Balakhnin has taken power following the events that saw the discussion of the legitimacy of the heir of the principality by our rivals in Moscow. Nizhny Novgorod is now our puppet and Balakhnin assures us that the current situation will soon 'be resolved' as the melancholy of the Prince is becoming more evident each day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS31.A;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.T;The end of the Principality;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.D;Events unfolded quickly in the principality. Alexey was found dead, hanging in his residence. The prince always had depressive excesses and the news of his suicide did not surprise any at the court. His death was masked as a 'bad fall' to not tarnish his memory but as soon as he was buried Balakhnin moved. Disregarding heir Mikhail as an infant, and the Duma still dissolved, he convened an assembly of firendly boyars and together offered the crown to the senior Belsky branch in Yaroslavl. Meanwhile the dowager princess was abducted by remnants of the Moscow faction, and sent her to her brother who made her abdicate her claims to the principality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS32.A;What just happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.T;Anna's gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS33.D;On the advice of his wife, Alexey asked the Duma to confirm Mikhail as heir of the principality but faced opposition from the boyars who refused to acknowledge his successor given Muscovite accusations. His attempt to dissolve the Duma and enforce his succession by decree failed due to the betrayal of military figures close to the pro-Moscow circle including Grigory Varankin, a former paramour of his wife. In the chaos that followed, the three leaders of the boyar cliques in Nizhny Novgorod all had their chance at power. Balakhnin proposed to reconvene the Duma while purging the Muscovite with the help of Yaroslavl, Grigory Varankin's soldiers were ready to take power and reclaim the lands of Ivanovo from Yaroslavl with Muscovian help while Anna Lyapunova urged the General Temey Talantsev secure the regency for her son.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS34.T;Varankin secures power Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS34.D;Grigory Varankin, a Moscow-aligned nizhegorodian military man, has sidelined prince Alexy and princess Anna and assumed power in Nizhny Novgorod. The general has declared his intention to reclaim Ivanovo from yaroslavl with our support. Of course, in actuality he has ceded the principality to us. Yaroslavl is outraged by the coup, decrying the actions of Varankin as illegitimate and unlawful, and vowing to bring Nizhny Novgorod down by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS34.A;Time to march north!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.T;Varankin seizes power in Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.D;Grigory Varankin, a Moscow-aligned nizhegorodian military man, has sidelined prince Alexy and princess Anna and stole Nizhny Novgorod away to the muscovites. Varankin has declared his intention to reclaim Ivanovo from us with support from Moscow. Varankin has effectively ceded the authority of Nizhny Novgorod to Moscow, and his aggressive posturing is tantamount to a declaration of war! How should we respond to this affront?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.A;We will restore our rule over Nizhny Novgorod once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS35.B;Can we really afford an armed confrontation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.T;Nizhny Novgorod asks for help;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.D;Temey Talantsev is a Nizhegorodian general of Mari-Chuvash origins, who has managed to become the regent during the chaos that ensued after Nizhny Novgorods succession crisis. Now both Moscow and yaroslavl are ready to pounce on the principality. Furthermore, Nizhny Novgorod has petitioned us for help against both of their neighbours./n/n This venture could prove to be very dangerous for Kazan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.A;We embrace Nizhny Novgorods call to arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS36.B;Are they out of their minds?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.T;Regent Talantsev calls for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.D;Regent Talantsev has asserted Nizhny Novgorods by executing sympathetic agents of Moscow and Yaroslavl that have operated in the army and the Duma. Now, as relations between us, Moscow, and yaroslavl are in shambles, the regnet wishes to take the fight to yaroslavl and Moscow as a way to put their political meddling to an end. Most of our government fears this proposition and believes this idea to hasten the demise of the principality, but the regent remains steadfast.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.A;We will bring the schemers to their knees!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS37.B;We must back away from this insanity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.T;Pouncing on Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.D;The Muscovite scheme has blown up in their face. Nizhny Novgorod, Moscow and yaroslavl are now locked in a war together, and letting Moscow get away with their schemes is unacceptable. Our government has decided to take advantage of Moscows folly and strike while the iron is hot. We will launch an attack on the principality of Moscow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS38.A;Moscow will pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.T;Denunciation of the heir;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.D;The Prince of Yaroslavl has refused to recognize our heir as legitimate, accusing the new heir of being a bastard, and citing adultery on the part of princess Anna Lyapunova as the reason. As a response to this outcry, the pro-Yaroslavl faction of the Duma began to accuse the princess of despotism and attempted to replace her with Count Balakhnin as the regent of Nizhny Novgorod. Fortunately, the army has come to the princess aid and refused to make any moves against her. The situation does not remain under control for long, a few months later Prince Alexy suddenly collapses during dinner with Anna and his entourage, he spends the next days under intense medical care before finally dying. Nizhny Novgorod swirls up in chaos as the bickering factions of the Duma begin to accuse one another of assassinating the prince. Some accuse the princess, while some accuse the Yaroslavl faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.A;Grigory Varankin arrests the princess! (Will result in Nizhny Novgorods annexation);;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS39.B;The army supports the princess!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS40.T;Moscow occupies Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS40.D;General Varankin has decided to exploit the situation in Moscows favor. Under the cover of night the general, surrounded by other Moscow loyalists, has entered the residence of the princess and arrested both her and the heir Mikhail. The group has quickly whisked the two away to Moscow. The prince of Moscow has acted quickly and advanced into Nizhny Novgorod unopposed. The end of a sovereign Nizhny Novgorod is here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS40.A;Moscow ascendent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS41.T;Nizhny Novgorod captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS41.D;Our agents in Nizhny Novgorod have managed to wrestle control over the principality following Prince Alexys death. Princess Anna Lyapunov and her son were arrested and brought to Moscow, and our armies have marched through her former principality unopposed. All is looking good, if it wasnt for Yaroslavl. Yaroslavl has condemned our occupation of what it perceives to be its lawful and sovereign land, and its apparent that the prince of Yaroslavl is already preparing his army for a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS41.A;They will run with their tail between their legs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS42.T;Princess Anna confirmed as regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS42.D;With the backing of the army, Princess Annah Lyapunova has managed to crush and purge the pro-Yaroslavl faction of the Duma. Now with a compliant Duma, the princess has managed to get the Duma to officially confirm her as the Princess-Regent of Nizhny Novgorod.Wasting no time, the princess-regent has appointed the half-Tatar General Talantsev as her prime minister, together the two began to introduce reforms to centralize the state, keep the boyars in line, and rein in the middle class. The princess-regent has also taken an aggressive stance on Yaroslavl and the lands of Ivanovo, promising to bring this lawful part of Nizhny Novgorod into the fold. On the other hand, Moscow and Yaroslavl are not impressed with our new government and the harsh treatment of the boyars who holds loyalties to their principalities, and the already shaken relations between our nations have all but disintegrated, as the two hostile princes will surely take on a violent approach to deal with our sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS42.A;Let them come! The princess-regent and Nizhny Novgorod are ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS43.T;Moscow and Yaroslavl recognize our heir!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS43.D;To our surprise, both the princes of Yaroslavl and Moscow have recognized Mikhail Belsky as the new heir to Nizhny Novgorod. We hope that today might mark the beginning of a more friendly relationship between our domains. In any case, it seems that for now the position of our heir is secured.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS43.A;God save Mikhail Belsky!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS44.T;General Grigory Varankin dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS44.D;The Moscow aligned General Grigory Varankin has recently died under suspicious circumstances. The generals corpse was discovered frozen in the Oka river during the early hours of the morning. In the following days the Duma became a battleground as Yaroslavl-friendly members of the Duma began to accuse Princess Anna of assassinating General Varankin with the help of her lover General Talantsev. The muscovite faction of the Duma is especially harsh on Talantsev, attacking and emphasizing his Tatar heritage./n/nSensing the change in course, Talantsev flees to Kazan while Annas allies slowly back away from the scene. In a last bid to save their princely power, Anna implores Prince Alexy to take action against the chaos and intrigue of the Duma. The prince wont budge. Coherency is all but lost in the Duma.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS44.A;Cant anything work out here?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.T;Prince Alexy abdicates;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.D;The Green Prince, sensing that the end is near, has officially announced his abdication, the prince is preparing to depart to a monastery to live out the rest of his life. But in a last ditch effort to salvage his legacy, the prince has petitioned the Duma to officially pronounce Anna Lyapunova as princess-regent. Princess Anna, unfortunately, has lost all of her allies, as both the Moscow and Yaroslavl factions of the Duma have torn her and each other apart. There are talks of a partition between Yaroslavl and Moscow, and even downright war. Stories from the east have also begun to surface, they speak of a disgraced tatar general gathering supporters for a final bid for power...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.A;Yaroslavl marches on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.B;Moscow Marches on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS45.C;Talantsev returns from exile and crushes his opposition!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS46.T;Nizhny Novgorod captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS46.D;As Prince Alexy of Nizhny Novgorod has finally abdicated from his throne, the nizhgorodian Duma has been thrown into chaos. However our sympathizers in the Duma have managed to secure a strong enough of a foothold to allow us to march unopposed into the city!/n/nUnfortunately, we now face opposition from Moscow, who view the restoration of our rule as unlawful and illegitimate. The muscovites are allegedly already preparing for an armed conflict as their forces muster at our borders...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS46.A;The Yaroslav Faction is victorious. §RGAME OVER§W;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS46.B;The Moscow Faction is victorious. §RGAME OVER§W;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS46.C;Talantsev is victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS47.T;Nizhny Novgorod captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS47.D;Despite the death of our main representative in Nizhny Novgorod, General Grigory Varankin, our agents in Nizhny Novgorod have managed to wrestle control over the principality following Prince Alexys abdication. His wife, Princess Anna, was powerless to control the army, and our forces marched through her former principality unopposed. All is looking good, if it wasnt for Yaroslavl. Yaroslavl has condemned our occupation of what it perceives to be its lawful and sovereign land, and its apparent that the prince of Yaroslavl is already preparing his army for a conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS47.A;They will run with their tail between their legs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS48.T;Our heir remains unrecognized!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS48.D;The princes of Moscow and Yaroslavl have rejected the legitimacy of our heir, Mikhail Belsky! They claim that Alexys effeminate nature and dubious sexuality muddies the circumstances of his sons birth and throws the whole ordeal into question. Alexys reaction is even more surprising, the Green Prince has come out of isolation and began to assert himself (against the wishes of his aides) as the ruler of the principality. Anna Lyapunov has not taken this encroachment kindly. The princess views towards a modernist government and military strongly contrasts against her husbands humanist and democratic views, and his hatred of secret police and the death penalty. This conflict between the princely consorts has created a divide in the government and Duma of Nizhny Novgorod, and now two factions, a pro-Alexy and pro-Anna have been formed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS48.A;A shocking turn of events!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.T;General Talantsev is killed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.D;Controversy rocks Nizhny Novgorod as the death of General Talantsev, one of Princess Annas closest allies, is made public. The general has been killed while apparently plotting the assassination of Prince Alexy and the burning of his dacha to make it look like an accident! His death by his former co-conspirator is now the topic of a heated discussion, some believe Princess Anna to be behind Talantsevs plot, but others claim that the entire event was coaxed by the Green Prince to kill one of his wifes allies. The Duma is currently at a crossroad, theres great confusion regarding whos allied to whom, and the military is beginning to grow very distrustful towards the Duma and the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.A;Prince Alexy arrests Anna and restores order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS49.B;The army remains loyal to Princess Anna!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.T;Nizhny Novgorod arrests Princess Anna Lyapunov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.D;Upon the rejection of our recognition of their heir, the prince and princess of Nizhny Novgorod have begun to bicker among themselves. And now after an attempt on his feeble life, Prince Alexy has arrested his own wife Anna Lyapunov with the help of that scoundrel General Varankin! Our own royalty now rots in a Nizhgorodian prison. Our aides now encourage us to send an offer to Prince Alexy: to recognise his heir in favor of the freedom of the member of our princely family./n/nsome see this as a show of weakness, but most believe that Yaroslavl would make a move on the Nizhgorodians if wed let the situation deteriorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.A;Send the ultimatum!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS50.B;Perhaps we should not intervene...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS51.T;Moscow offers recognition for the release of the princess;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS51.D;Prince Alexy has wrestled control over the principality and arrested Princess Anna with the help of the ruthless General Varankin. Together the two have dissolved the Duma and proclaimed the autocracy of Alexey Belsky, while Varankin was appointed as the Plenipotentiary Minister. While Alexy has managed to push some serf reforms, his minister has held most of the power in Nizhny Novgorod. This struggle has been interrupted by Moscow, who offered Alexy recognition of his rule as the prince of Nizhny Novgorod for the release of Princess Anna Lyapunov, a member of Moscows princely family./nPrince Alexy is naturally ecstatic about the chance to ensure his rule and the independence of his state. Varankin on the other hand does not trust Moscow, and a vicious struggle between the two has begun behind the scenes...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS51.A;Cant we just reach an agreement?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.T;Coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.D;Prince Alexy and Minister Varankins cooperation has reached its end point. Today the prince is ordering the army to detain and remove minister Varankin from his post, fearing that Varankin would do to him as he has done to the princess over their dispute regarding Moscows offer./n/nAt the same time however, the minister has started to march through the streets of Nizhny Novgorod, flanked by a mounted cavalry company friendly to him. The band is currently marching towards the princes residence while civilians flee the scene. Varankin is steadfast in his distrust of Moscow, and believes that removing Alexy before he agrees to Moscows ultimatum is the only way to preserve the regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.A;Varankin enters the compound and guns Alexy down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS52.B;Alexy intercepts Varankin and executes him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.T;The prince of Nizhny Novgorod dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.D;A battle has briefly raged on in Nizhny Novgorod. At its end, prince Alexy Belsky has been gunned down and dismembered by his own minister, General Grigory Varankin. Due to our refusal to recognise the dead princes son as the heir of Nizhny Novgorod, we officially view the throne of the principality as vacant. We may have the opportunity to press forwards and claim the principality as our own! However, we should keep in mind that Moscow will not take this move lightly...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.A;Claim the throne of Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS53.B;Perhaps we shouldnt encourage a Muscovite retaliation...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.T;Moscow prepares to move on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.D;An insurgency has briefly raged on in Nizhny Novgorod. At its end, prince Alexy Belsky has won out against his own minister, General Grigory Varankin, who attempted to rebel out of disagreements regarding negotiations with Moscow. But the princes negotiations with the traitorous Muscovite have been for nothing, as news from Moscow hint that its prince is preparing to betray Nizhny Novgorod and make war on it! Some of our advisors have suggested offering prince Alexy our protection against Moscow in favor of vassalage. But due to our refusal to recognise the dead princes son as the heir of Nizhny Novgorod, we may be able to declare Alexey as unfit to rule and press our own claim on the throne. In that case, we should expect Muscovite resistance...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.A;Send Alexey an offer of friendship...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS54.B;Well strike now! Down with Nizhny Novgorod, and down with Moscow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.T;Moscow betrays the agreement!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.D;To the shock of the Green Prince, the Muscovites did not honor their agreement. Our claim to the throne remains snubbed, and the principality has begun to mass its armies in preparation for war! But perhaps we have a chance to survive this catastrophe. Yaroslavl has approached Prince Alexy with an offer, Commit your principality to a closer bond with ours, and well help you. The court understands the meaning of this offer, and most of Alexeys aides push the prince to accept as a last ditch effort to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.A;Well bend the knee...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS55.B;After Im through with Moscow, YOU are next Yaroslavl!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.T;Nizhny Novgorod returns Anna Lyapunov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.D;The Nizhgorodians have buckled under our pressure and released Anna Lyapunov to us! Now we have a magnificent opportunity to press our claim on the whole of Nizhny Novgorod! Without Princess Anna at the helm, we may revoke our recognition of Alexeys child and declare him unfit to rule, leaving us with a casus belli to take the principality to ourselves! Of course this will provoke Yaroslavl to action, but how could we pass on this opportunity?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.A;To Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS56.B;We cant break our promise...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS57.T;Princess Anna restores order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS57.D;Despite Prince Alexys position as the de jure authority in the principality, Anna Lyapunov has managed to make powerful allies among the army and the boyars. Following the consorts' struggle for power, the princess has managed not only to sideline the Green Prince, but also to imprison him on charges of conspiracy against her and the principality! Now aided by Count Balakhnin, the princess has been declared Princess-Regent and began to purge the principality of her enemies. But not all is well for Anna, for Prince Alexy has died in his prison cell a few short weeks after his fall from power. Currently Yaroslavl, whose prince is the cousin of Alexy, is enraged by his imprisonment. Should he find out that the Green Prince is dead, well be in great trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS57.A;Keep calm and dont let the truth leak;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS58.T;Prince Alexys becomes public!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS58.D;Our fears have manifested! The death of Prince Alexy has become public due to a leak by one of the prisons officers. We havent heard from Yaroslavl yet, but since they never recognized Mikhail as the heir of Nizhny Novgorod, they might just claim the principality for themselves as the only legitimate member of the Belsky family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS58.A;Call the army! Prepare for the worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.T;Alexy Belsky dies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.D;To our shock Prince Konstantins cousin, Prince Alexy, has died! He has succumbed to illness in a Nizhgorodian cell. Our court naturally blames his death on the negligence of his traitorous wife who imprisoned him in the first place, Anna Lyapunov. Due to our stance on the princess son, Mikhail, as an illegitimate heir, we may have an opportunity to claim the throne of Nizhny Novgorod back! Naturally, we must expect Moscow to come to the aid of Anna Lyapunov, as the princess is from its royal family.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.A;Vengeance for Belskys blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS59.B;Can we afford to antagonize Moscow?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.T;Moscow advances on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.D;Moscow has moved into Nizhny Novgorod, seizing unlawfully what is naturally the integral and rightful land of the principality. Calls for war are heard throughout the land, calls for the reclamation of Yaroslavls birthright, and for dismemberment of the vain muscovites!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.A;We musnt let Moscow get away with this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS60.B;We cant afford to challenge Moscow...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.T;Yaroslavl advances on Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.D;Yaroslavl has already occupied Ivanovo for long enough, but now Yaroslavl has exploited the chaos in the principality and moved into Nizhny Novgorod itself, completing their vile conquest of what would be better off in our hands. Calls for war are heard throughout the land, calls to put Yaroslavls crime to an end, and to restore the honor and glory of Moscow and her prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.A;We mustn't let Yaroslavl covet whats ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS61.B;We cant afford to challenge Yaroslavl...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS62.T;Victory in the Nizhgorodian war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS62.D;Our prince and his loyal army have marched out to meet greedy Yaroslavl in battle! And victorious our prince and country are. By beating Yaroslav back, and asserting our rightful claim to Nizhny Novgorod, we have gotten closer to our dream of a Russian empire. Let prince Konstantin fear our advance, for no petty principality can stop Moscows destiny now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS62.A;Moscow emerges victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS63.T;Victory in the Nizhgorodian war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS63.D;Belskys birthright is once again restored! Our rightful claim to the principality of Nizhny Novgorod, that has been confirmed already by the right of blood, has now been confirmed by the right of conquest! Moscow is beaten and has fled back to their own land, while Prince Konstantin celebrates our successful campaign in Nizhny Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS63.A;Yaroslavl emerges victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.T;Moscow offers annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.D;In an expected delegate from Moscow, Princess Anna has received an offer from Prince Peter III of Moscow: the cession Nizhny Novgorod in return for monetary compensation for the princess-regent. Princess Anna may retire to live the rest of her life in leisure if she cedes the principality to her familys hands. The court patiently awaits the princess response...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.A;Princess Anna accepts the deal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS64.B;Princess-regent Anna rejects the deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.T;The Generalissimo of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.D;Years ago, Talantsev was a minor noble coming from a Chuvash elder family that had made fortune on the Volga between the Khanate of Kazan and the Russian principalities. His talents were recognized and he gained rank thanks to the affection of Anna Lyupanova. But in the end he took power in the troubled times that faced Nizhny Novgorod abolishing the principality and taking the helm. He defended the independence of the city and proved to the people that he was a natural leader. Thanks to his new popularity he was able to crush boyar opposition and proclaim the end of serfdom. Now he has turned back on its Tatar allies claiming to free the people of Tartariya from slavery as he liberated serfs. This could serve him in the next fights against the Princes of Russia, and maybe he can become the providential man needed to unify the eastern Slavs?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS65.A;Long live the Vozhd!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.T;The Princess of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.D;Anna Lyapunova won against all odds. A princess whose sole job was to marry and produce an heir, she managed to surpass every expectations, sidelining her husband and ruling over the principality in its most troubled times. A master of intrigue she went from regent for her son Mikhail to princess ruling in her own right. The Duma has been abolished after her control over the state was affirmed and her first ukaze as autocrat of Nizhny Novgorod was to free the serfs living under her rule. The people have forgotten the scandals that surrounded her while Alexey was still around and she has been nicknamed the 'Mother of the People' by many pamphlets and all her trips over the country see crowds of former serfs gather to acclaim her. This opinion is shared by many in her home in Moscow, with many abolitionists looking up to the rising figure of the Lyapunov family to unify the principalities and maybe then all Russia !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS66.A;Long live the Princess!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS660.T;The Survival of Nizhny Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS660.D;Against all odds, Nizhny Novogrod has survived when by all means it should have been dissolved during the previous crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS660.A;Long live the... somebody?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.T;Threat from the West;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.D;The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is one of the main instigators behind the current situation in Russia. When at the apex of its power, the Polish Crown claimed the title of Prince of the Rus and invaded the Principalities provoking the Troubles (1592-1613). More recently they were the main instigators of the Nizhny Novgorod war, and Smolensk only regained its independence thanks to the decay of the Polish state apparatus. But now the new King of the Commonwealth has reformed the state and the country is now again a major force in Europe. The Princes of Russia must unite if they want to have a chance against the Polish Leviathan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS67.A;A new troubled Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.T;The Nordic threat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.D;The Scandinavians have intervened in Russia for centuries, as Rurik and Oleg settled and founded Rus while Novgorod fought Swedish and Danish attacks in the times of Alexander Nevsky. More recently the Republic of the North was forced to release the Republic of Pskov that then acquired the Baltic coast. Following the Neva war, the Scandinavians controlled the influx of goods into Novgorod and gained enormous influence in Russia, even pitting the Iaroslav prince against Moscow during the German Wars. Now the Scandinavians have attacked Novgorod and acquired proper Russian territory. It is an insult to all independent powers in Russia and has prompted every ruler to arm its subjects to unify the country once and for all, lest we are played once again by other powers and the Motherland is carved by them !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS68.A;For the glory of Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS69.T;Loss of Nordic influence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS69.D;The Scandinavians have intervened in Russia for centuries, as Rurik and Oleg settled and founded Rus while Novgorod fought Swedish and Danish attacks in the times of Alexander Nevsky. More recently the Republic of the North was forced to release the Republic of Pskov that then acquired the Baltic coast. Following the Neva war, the Scandinavians controlled the influx of goods into Novgorod and gained enormous influence in Russia, even pitting the Iaroslav prince against Moscow during the German Wars. But now Scandinavian's influence is waning as events in Finland have provoked independence of core territories of the Nordic Crown. The states in Central Russia are now left to their own devices as no Great Power can actually reach out to them, and the unification of Central Russia should be swift and decisive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS69.A;Unification or death!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.T;A rumor in Russia...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.D;Central Russia has been never truly unified as all attempts failed due to foreign powers interventions and local fighting forces. Ivan III of Moscow, Dimitri I of Tver, Feodor II of Yaroslav all look down on what Russia has become and what could have been. There is a rising sentiment that Russia must evolve to survive in the modern world and that the divisions must go away for a new nation emerge and protect the Motherland from all threats. Now is the time to forge a new Principality of Rus that will avenge the woes that Russia has suffered over the centuries!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS70.A;But please do not repeat!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS71.T;The Muscovite Wars era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS71.D;Tensions had grown between the principalities of Central Russia over the last decades, only tampered by the possibility of foreign intervention. Now that this threat is gone, every leader in Central Russia wants to claim the title and power of the Grand Principality of Rus, which few rulers could claim in the history of Russia. No longer shall Central Russia be divided, and the masses are armed and ready for the coming fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS73.T;The Unification of Muscovy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS73.D;From the ashes of the divided principalities of Central Russia emerges Muscovy, following the path traced by Ivan III the failed 'Tsar', Dimitri I 'the Savior' and Feodor II of Yaroslav. The Muscovite wars have claimed countless lives and now soldiers go back to their fields and cities to renew with a more normal life. This is the first stage for a new Russia to emerge but to avoid the fates of those who failed before, the ruler of Muscovy must now administrate the new lands under their control and let the land and its inhabitants rest before they take on new enemies and forge a true Russian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS73.A;The first victory in the series of many!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS74.T;The Muscovite Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS75.A;For Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
CRUS76.T;The Unification of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS76.D;Woe be upon us! Our worst fears have been realized! After a period of anarchy, the princes of central Russia have been united into a single nation. Now the Russians stand united against their external enemies, and we can only pray that they show leniency in their dealings with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS76.A;We shall not go down without a fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.T;Submission to $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.D;After having won out over the other Russian princes, the ruler of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ now claims sovereignty over the entire Russian nation -- at least, what they perceive it to be. Unfortunately for us, their perceptions of Russia include the lands of our nation. A representative from the $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us, demanding our annexation. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.A;Can we even resist?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS77.B;These pretenders shall never have control of our nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS770.T;Submission of the Cossack Hosts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS770.D;By force or guile we have usurped the other princes and obtained a dominant position in the Russian heartland. Having secured the home front, our interests now look towards the Russians not yet united with our nation. Despite a diverse set of origins, the Cossacks are ultimately Russian in language, culture, and religion, making the independent hosts of the Wild Fields an integral part of the Russian nation. Being part of the first Russian states to live free from foreign meddling, surely the spirit of the Russian dream lives in the people of the hosts! We will petition the rulers of the independent hosts to willingly accept annexation to the growing Russian state. Those that refuse may find their people liberated from their tyrannical rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS770.A;The Cossacks are Russians: they must be a part of a united Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS78.T;The Unification of $FROMCOUNTRY$ and the Russian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS78.D;Emerging from the chaos that embroiled the south, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has succeeded in uniting the disparate principalities of central Russia into a single unified state. They now stand as the sole power in central Russia, powerful enough and secure enough to challenge the remaining Russian states in their quest to obtain dominance over all Russia. It remains clear to all observers that $FROMCOUNTRY$ seeks the complete unification of the Russian nation -- a project that naturally includes the lands of northern Russia. Many among us see benefits to be had in our joining a unified Russian state. Depending on what they may offer us, we may even choose to willingly unite with $FROMCOUNTRY$. It remains to be seen, however, whether we can reconcile our differences, but at the very least we will hear them out on any offers they may make -- it certainly beats fighting a war over the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS78.A;Let them know that we are listening. Now it is up to them to reciprocate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS79.T;The End of the Novgorodian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS79.D;For some time now the inherent contradictions in the structure of the confederation have caused the rise of factionalism within our government, with the ever-present threat of the Russians from the south the only factor uniting these factions in support of the confederation. However, with recent events, these factions have come to a head, throwing the entire confederation into disarray. Princes and republics alike are in open revolt against the authority of the Prince of Novgorod, with neither party satisfied with his rule. The Prince retains authority only over the city of Novgorod and the surrounding territories, and with any attempts at compromise being too little and too late, the remaining representatives of the Veche and the Council of Lords have unanimously declared dissolved the Novgorodian Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS79.A;If only we had reformed sooner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS80.T;Secret Attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS80.D;It is absolutely obvious that the reunification of Russia is impossible without Novgorod. Its current masters, the Prince and his puppeteers, however, are weak and cannot control anything outside the city itself. We have a favorable offer for them - in exchange for recognition of our monarch's authority, they will all receive large estates and, ahem, monetary compensation. Our diplomats have already left for Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS80.A;Time to end the Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS81.T;Palace Coup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS81.D;Despite the fact that the Prince himself suddenly showed no desire to give up the phantom remnants of his power, those respectable gentlemen behind him forced him to swear an oath to the ruler of All Russia. For this, all those involved received large estates as well as a solid annual pension. Those few who refused to obey the outsiders from the south began a desperate, but pointless and short struggle - soon they will all obey the Tsar, of that there can be no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS82.T;The Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS82.D;The Cabal, which rules Novgorod, no longer controls anything other than the city itself and its nearest outskirts. Our monarch's closest advisers have suggested a great idea - if we offer the rulers of Novgorod nobility, large estates, and a decent pension, they might agree to recognize our authority. We will also make it clear to them that, if they refuse, a forceful intervention is imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS83.T;An Offer for Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS83.D;We received a strange offer from the ruler of Velikorussia. In exchange for loyalty oaths, our elites are offered substantial land grants, nobility, and a pension from the Grand Prince. This offer could only be laughed at if it were not for the second part: if we refuse, we are threatened with war. Not all among the elites are confident in our ability to win this war, so accepting the offer may not be such a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS83.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS83.B;Novgorod will never surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS84.T;The Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS84.D;The Cabal, which rules Novgorod, no longer controls anything other than the city itself and its nearest outskirts. Our dictator's closest advisers have suggested a great idea - if we threaten the rulers of Novgorod with a war, they might agree to recognize our authority. We will make it clear to them - a forceful intervention is imminent.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS84.A;Simple as always.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS85.T;The Threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS85.D;We received a strange offer from the ruler of Velikorussia. We are ordered to obey. If we do not recognize their sovereignty over Novgorod, they threaten to declare war on us. Not all among the elites are confident in our ability to win this war, so accepting the offer may not be such a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS85.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS85.B;Novgorod will never surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS86.T;Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS86.D;The Republic and its future are the responsibility of every citizen. This is the main principle of our state, expressed by its founder. The idea of the unification of the Russian lands has long agitated the minds of many citizens of our republic. In recent years the Novgorod Republic has become much weaker than before, and the most audacious liberals among us have floated the idea of holding a plebiscite in Novgorod to unite with other Russian lands.It is absolutely clear that the citizens of Novgorod, tired of instability, will choose a strong and united Russia, so we should only wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS86.A;Get the champagne ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS87.T;Great Unification Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS87.D;When diplomats from the south came to propose a plebiscite on reunification, many were skeptical. At this point, however, it is obvious to all that the Novgorod Republic is over, and the end of our independence is only a matter of time. In the plebiscite held today, the proposal for reunification received an absolute majority of votes. On the streets, people rejoice at the end of the turbulent instability and look forward to the bright future - a future in a unified Russian republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CRUS88.A;A plan B? That's how we call that?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS89.T;Great Unification Referendum;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CRUS89.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS89.B;Novgorod will never surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS90.T;The end of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS90.D;The greater Novgorodian Republic, our former master, is now gone. A new hegemon has bent over the ruins of the ancient city, and now we are all alone in the face of an imminent threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS90.A;We are small, but not meaningless!;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS91.T;Question of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS91.D;Now, with Novgorod gone, we have to make a decision. Should we join the new Russian hegemon voluntarily? No official ambassadors have been sent to us to propose annexation, but it is absolutely clear that such a thing will happen soon. If we do not join now, we will be forced to face the military force of a united Russia -- a force that will be difficult, if not impossible, to defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS91.A;We will submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
CRUS91.B;We are small, but not meaningless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS92.T;Pan-Russianism in Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS92.D;While Lord Novgorod the Great has managed to resolve its internal struggles, it has thus far remained divorced from the affairs of the other Russian principalities. Novgorod's isolation has upset the pan-Russian factions within Novgorod, who believe that the city should leverage its influence and unite the disparate Russian states into a single nation. Our recent ascent however has convinced many supporters of the pan-Russian movement in Novgorod that $COUNTRY$ and not Novgorod is the true heir of Rurik, and to that end we have taken the opportunity to aid our brethren within Novgorod in fulfilling our destiny as the natural leader of all Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS92.A;Novgorod must bend her knee to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.T;The Pan-Russian Revolt of $year$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.D;While pan-Russian demonstrations have become common in recent years, the successful reassertion of our hegemony over the confederation has de-legitimized most such movements, allowing us to keep them in check. However, a pan-Russian revolt the likes of which we have never seen has recently broken out all across the country, paralyzing communications and diverting our forces away from the capital. Taking advantage of the chaos, a group of partisans has advanced on the Veche and the Council of Lords in an attempt to coerce them into electing the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ as Prince of Novgorod. While there can be no doubt that our southern neighbors are responsible for this attempted coup, our main concern is to deal with the threat of these rebels. How shall we react?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.A;Our forces have been overwhelmed. Stand down lest there be more unnecessary bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS93.B;All is not yet lost! We will eject these would-be usurpers from Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS94.T;Union with Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS94.D;After some initial difficulties, the pan-Russian revolters we supported have succeeded in uniting Lord Novgorod the Great to our nation! Our king has been confirmed as the rightful Prince of Novgorod by both the Novgorodian Veche and the Council of Lords. After centuries of independence, however, the people of Novgorod are reluctant to accept the rule of what many see as a foreign usurper of the title of Prince. Armed bands of peasants and former Novgorodian garrisons alike rove the countryside, extorting the populace and thwarting our efforts to effect any sort of control over much of Novgorod. While Novgorod may now be ours -- that much will not change -- it will be some time before we can integrate these lands effectively into our administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS94.A;With this union we have been saved from causing unnecessary bloodshed. Now we must reconcile with Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS95.T;Pan-Russian Separatists Flee South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS95.D;Despite some initial victories, the soldiers of Novgorod managed to hold key positions within the city of Novgorod, including the Veche and the Princes palace. With the initial shock of the uprising having worn off, the pan-Russian separatists were no longer able to compensate for the irregular nature of their forces, and having found themselves steadily losing ground to the armies of Novgorod, the pan-Russian rebels hastily withdrew from the city. Similar word has been heard throughout the rest of Novgorod, with pan-Russian rebels having been routed by local garrisons and even peasant militias hostile to their brigandry. Those surviving groups of rebels have fled across the border to their masters in the south, and only time will tell how our southern neighbor will react to this failed plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS95.B;Let us hope these fleas do not signal the arrival of rats from the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS96.T;The Conference of Kostroma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS96.D;With $COUNTRY$'s consolidation of power over the formerly independent princes of central Russia, Russians everywhere excitedly convene to discuss the imminent completion of Russian unification. In $CAPITAL$ and in Novgorod alike, intellectuals gather at coffeehouses to debate the nature a unified Russian nation should take, and everywhere one can find ministers and statesmen working to make the Russian dream a reality. The newest source of gossip in these circles is the ongoing Conference of Kostroma between $COUNTRY$ and Novgorod. $COUNTRY$ has been attempting to peacefully form some sort of union with Novgorod, uniting the Russian people into a single nation. To that end, $COUNTRY$ has proposed a referendum to decide the fate of Novgorod and subsequently the future of the entire Russian nation. Russians everywhere await with bated breath to see what the results of such a referendum would be, or even if the Novgorodian government would agree to such a proposal in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS96.A;The unification of Russia is at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.T;A Referendum for the Future of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.D;Having previously agreed to conduct a referendum throughout the entirety of Novgorod regarding our possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we have now counted the final tally. The results are clear: union with $FROMCOUNTRY$ has won a majority. However, while the pan-Russian supporters have won a majority, their majority is not overwhelming, and a large portion of our population still supports the independence of our state. Supporters of our independence within the government have begun to congregate and scheme to preserve the existence of the Novgorodian state. While it would alienate large parts of the populace, we could lend their movement our tacit support and renege on the results of the referendum. Such a move, however, would certainly infuriate our southern neighbor and render our government as little more than a puppet of the independence faction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.A;We will respect the will of the Novgorodian people. Russia shall be united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS97.B;$FROMCOUNTRY$ will have to pry Novgorod from our cold, dead hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS98.T;The Novgorodian Rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS98.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ thought they could woo us with promises of the preservation of our ancient rights, guaranteed positions within the new government, and financial compensation for titles lost. It seems that they do not understand that our sovereignty is not for sale, and that we will not give in to their demands. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ delegation has left the conference infuriated with what they denounce as pig-headed obstinacy, meanwhile we have satisfied ourselves with having driven home our right to sovereignty to these foreigners. Hopefully this will finally put to rest all this nonsense of Russian unification and we can return to the status quo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS98.A;Surely nothing could go wrong with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS99.T;Talks Break Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS99.D;Despite our overtures of a peaceful and equitable union between our two nations, and despite our promises to ensure that all parties involved were duly compensated, the Novgorodians have rejected any offers to unite with us. The Conference of Kostroma has been deemed a failure, causing us embarrassment for having even considered negotiation with such pig-headed fools. One of our ministers has approached us with one last-ditch effort at unification with Novgorod before the situation escalates into a full-scale war. Pan-Russian undercurrents flow strongly within the Novgorodian populace, and the harsh Novgorodian regime has led many in Novgorod to consider $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule to be more tenable than that of the Novgorodians. Our ministers have been in contact with a pan-Russian secret society called the Yaroslavl Circle for some time now, but were we to provide money and matériel we could inspire them to action. A successful uprising aimed at toppling the authoritarian Novgorodian government would surely install a government more amenable to our offers of Russian unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS99.A;We shall support this pan-Russian society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.T;The Yaroslavl Circle Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.D;While the pan-Russian tide has been rising in recent years, our government has been overall successful in quashing any sort of dissent that would threaten Novgorod. Until now, that is. A pan-Russian revolt the likes of which we have never seen has broken out across the entire nation. Prominent officers and even whole garrisons have defected to their cause, leaving the entire Novgorodian army in disarray. The rebels, calling themselves the Yaroslavl Circle, already control a number of important cities and have begun to advance on the city of Novgorod in an attempt to restore the republic and elect the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ as the new Prince of Novgorod. Given their aims and their weapons there can be no doubt that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is responsible for this uprising, most likely in the event of talks breaking down. And given the rebels' success, perhaps we should have taken $FROMCOUNTRY$'s original offer for unification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.A;Salvage what we can, we will make peace with these rebels if they ensure our security!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS100.B;Never! We will turn these peasant hordes back to the fields and hovels from which they emerged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1000.T;The Invasion of the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1000.D;Having consolidated our hold over central Russia, the only thing standing in the way of our complete domination over the whole of Russia is the Novgorodian Confederation. Having decided to forego the diplomatic approach, we have already begun to mobilize our armies in preparation for a sneak attack on this last barrier to Russian unification. We are the sole masters of Russia, the true heirs of Rurik, and the people of Novgorod will soon learn that for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1000.A;Prepare the attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS101.T;A Grand Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS101.D;After centuries of slavery to foreign masters, the Russian nation stands on the cusp of unification. Against all odds, our republic has beaten out the old autocratic regimes of central Russia, uniting the formerly independent principalities to our own nation. At this moment, the majority of the Russian nation lives under our banner. The only remaining holdout preventing the realization of the Russian dream is Novgorod. While not the model upon which our democracy is based, the Novgorodian Confederation is nonetheless the most significant source of inspiration for our nascent republic. It was in Novgorod that the Russian nation first knew what it meant to be ruled by the people, and while the centuries were tumultuous, it was Novgorod that kept alive the flame of Rurik and of democracy in Russia. As we share this common ground of democracy with the Novgorodians, and as the Russian people yearn for the unification of the nation, let us come to terms with Novgorod in order to unite Russia as one people under one republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS101.A;Russia shall be united under liberal democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.T;A Grand Unification?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.D;After centuries of slavery to foreign masters, the Russian nation is on the cusp of unification. To our south, the autocratic princes of the old order have been vanquished, replaced by a confederation ruled by the once-oppressed Russian people themselves. Meanwhile, our own confederation has stood the test of time, preserving the flame of Rurik even in the face of threats external and internal. Having discussed back and forth with our newly-liberated southern neighbors, and despite the differences in our ancient traditions, the Novgorodian Veche has decreed that it is time democracy reign in Russia: Lord Novgorod the Great will unite with $FROMCOUNTRY$ for the good of the Russian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.A;We will unite with $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS102.B;Novgorod will lead this new confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS103.T;A Diplomatic Approach;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS103.D;Against all odds, our republic has prevailed over the chaos that embroiled central Russia, uniting the formerly autocratic principalities into a single state ruled by the people. The Russian nation now stands on the brink of unification, with the sole remaining thorn in our side being the Novgorodian Confederation. While the original inception of Novgorod as a confederation of equals served as a spiritual precedent for our own government, the ancient institutions of the Novgorodian Confederation have proven to be non-adaptive to the demands of a modern republic. In many ways Novgorod is a shell of its former self, having de-emphasized or even completely curtailed many of its democratic traditions in favor of a more autocratic style of rule. Despite this, it is imperative that the Russian nation be unified under the banner of democracy, and we must come to some agreement with the Novgorodians in order to accomplish this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS103.A;Make the offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.T;An Offer from the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.D;Emerging from the chaos that had embroiled the south, the peasant hordes that the southern princes once lorded over have overthrown their masters and achieved dominance over central Russia. While noble in intention, these peasants have proven incapable of grasping the subtleties of our ancient institutions, and in their attempts to imitate them under the guise of "liberalism" the people of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have made a mockery of our nation's legacy with their republic. And it is this bastardization of our ancient confederation that has dared claim the legacy of Rurik. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has recently sent us a diplomatic proposal demanding that we submit to them. Refusal would most likely mean war. Our surrender would not be without generous compensation, but it would certainly mean the loss of our sovereignty and our privileged position as the middleman between Russia and the rest of Europe. Honor demands that we reject their proposal, but pragmatism says otherwise. Which consideration will win out in the end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.A;Their offer is admittedly generous. We begrudgingly accept annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS104.B;We will never submit to peasants who cannot understand the subtleties of our confederation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.T;A Pre-Emptive Strike?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.D;With our refusal to accept the offer of our southern neighbors, military maneuvers along the border have rapidly increased in both frequency and intensity. It is only a matter of time now before war breaks out. Many of our top strategists are advocating a policy of pre-emptive action, favoring a surprise attack on key locations just across the border. The armies of our enemy will take quite a while to mobilize completely: by striking first, we can negate their numerical advantage. With our forces outnumbered, they argue that this is the only way we can ensure our victory in the upcoming war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.A;We must strike first, to ensure our own independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS105.B;Such a move would be dishonorable. We must not stoop so low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS106.T;A Pre-Emptive Strike!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS106.D;With our refusal to submit to our southern neighbors, military maneuvers along the border have rapidly increased in both frequency and intensity. It is only a matter of time now before war breaks out. Due to our numerical disadvantage, it is important that we strike first before the armies of our enemies are able to mobilize their forces. Otherwise we risk giving our enemy the time necessary for them to organize their armies to counter our offensive. These upstarts from the south will learn that we, not they, are the true heirs of Rurik! Russia shall be ours and ours alone to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS106.A;We must strike first in order to ensure our mastery over all Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS107.T;The Figurehead Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS107.D;Having obtained the success we have over the other Russian principalities, it is clear that our king possesses the divine right to rule over the whole of the Russian nation. The Prince of Novgorod remains the only man left standing in open defiance of our rule. The Prince, however, is little more than a figurehead in Novgorod: the true power of that state lies in its nobility, whose loyalties can be bought. If we make a proper offering to these petty nobles we can entirely bypass the rule of this so-called "Prince" and defeat Novgorod without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS107.A;Forget this Prince, we only seek to negotiate with those who possess actual power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS108.T;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Insult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS108.D;It is no surprise that this self-proclaimed "Tsar" in $FROMCOUNTRY$ desires the end of the Novgorodian state. What does come as a shock, however, is the means by which he has recently attempted to effect it. The prince of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has completely foregone diplomatic channels with our nation and has instead attempted to conduct individual dealings with the nobility. This abominable act is both a flagrant disregard for our status as an independent state and a personal insult to the authority of the Prince of Novgorod! While a few may have turned coat, those of whom we will punish severely later, the majority have rejected the offer of $FROMCOUNTRY$, professing loyalty to the Prince of Novgorod. Hopefully with this, $FROMCOUNTRY$ will know that neither our nobility nor our sovereignty can be bought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS108.A;How dare they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS109.T;The Plot Against the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS109.D;Surprisingly, the Novgorodian nobles have for the most part rejected our generous offer! Perhaps this figurehead prince holds more sway within Novgorod than we had initially realized. If we are able to get this prince out of the picture, however, surely we will see the mass defections of the Novgorodian nobility to our cause! Within Novgorod are various narodniks with anti-monarchical sentiments. While they may be dangerous to us in the long run, for now at least our ministers assure us that any one of these groups would readily serve as our unwitting agents in an attempt to assassinate the Prince of Novgorod, so long as we provide them the necessary support and obscure its origins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS109.A;We need not stoop so low ourselves. Let these peasants kill their lowly prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS110.T;An Assassination Attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS110.D;A bomb has been thrown at the princes carriage in an attempt to end his life! While the prince is unharmed, the question remains who would orchestrate such an act? The captured terrorists claim connection to some obscure narodnik organization. While the connection is credible, the group they name, while not necessarily unknown to us, is one with little history of previous action and is known to have had limited resources. It seems unlikely that this organization acted on its own. Further investigation reveals that known members of the group have in recent weeks made trips to the capital of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Considering the recent fallout between our two nations, it becomes clear that $FROMCOUNTRY$ wished to create a power vacuum in our nation in order to encourage the defection of the nobility. We will stand insult no longer! If $FROMCOUNTRY$ will not respect our sovereignty, then perhaps we shall not recognize theirs! The people of the south live oppressed under the rule of this self-proclaimed Tsar, and it is our sacred duty to liberate them and unite the Russian nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS110.A;We shall make them pay for endangering the life of the prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS111.T;The Divine Right of Kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS111.D;Having gained dominance over the formerly independent principalities of central Russia, it is clear -- to us at least -- that God favors us, and that we rule all Russia by divine right. These Novgorodians, however, fail to see how providence favors us. They persist in choosing rulers amongst themselves in what is little more than a glorified popularity contest, ignoring our rightful place as lords of Novgorod and Tsar of all Russia. However, they shall ignore us no longer! We have sent them an ultimatum demanding their complete and unconditional surrender. Should they fail to comply, we shall reign down destruction upon Novgorod the likes of which has never before been seen under heaven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS111.A;As God wills it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS112.T;The Reply of the Novgorodian Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS112.D;It is no secret that the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ desires the our lands. His rhetoric proclaiming a divine right to rule all Russia, and his usage of the title Tsar are indicative enough of his intentions. Thus, the most recent communiqué from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador comes as no surprise to any of the representatives in the Novgorodian Veche: $FROMCOUNTRY$ has demanded the dissolution of our republic and our annexation to their nation. Failure to do so will result in our complete and wholesale destruction for defying the will of God. Naturally, we have brushed aside his threats, though we have not sent his ambassador home empty handed. Having long expected this upcoming war, the Novgorodian Veche has unanimously approved a message addressed personally to this Tsar denouncing him as "$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ devil and damned devil's kith and kin, and informing him that he shall no longer, son of a whore, make slaves of Russian men. Should he come, this Muscovite scullion will find himself stripped of his crown by the hands of the Russian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS112.A;Screw thine own mother!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS113.T;Detente with Novgorod?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS113.D;Having triumphed over the chaos that embroiled central Russia, our nation has achieved dominance over the Russian heartland. Now the only stumbling block to Russian unification is our relationship with Novgorod. Novogord has never been on the most friendly of terms with the southern principalities. Nevertheless since achieving preeminence in the Russian heartland we have worked to improve our relations with the Novgorodian state. Recently we have begun diplomatic talks with the Novgorodians in order to see what terms, if any, they would consider acceptable in order to achieve political unification. Hopefully these talks will bear fruit and we will see the creation of a pan-Russian state, or at least the pathway to one. And if not, there are always other means by which to continue policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS113.A;Peace shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS114.T;The Diplomatic Farce;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS114.D;Despite the overtures of compromise, talks with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have proven to be little more than a farce! The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats refuse to budge on even the most simple of issues, rejecting reasonable proposals that would ensure our interests are protected. All the while, we have noted that the armies of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have begun to amass along the border. Many in Novgorod believe that these talks were meant as little more than a means by which $FROMCOUNTRY$ could stall in order to adequately mobilize their armies. The situation has recently come to a head, with Novgorodian sailors having been arrested by the soldiers of $FROMCOUNTRY$ for exercising their right to river navigation. With this final insult we refuse to negotiate any further with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Everyone from the coffeehouse intellectual, to the paper-pushing bureaucrat, and even the most pigheaded reactionary now sees that a unified Russia is inevitable. We must strike first and strike hard to ensure that we are the ones to head this new Russian order, and not our enemies in $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS114.A;Let slip the dogs of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS115.T;A Pro-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Coup?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS115.D;As we have assumed mastery of the Russian heartland, we are now able to effectively utilize the resources of this rich land to expand our power outwards throughout the rest of Russia. Our first target of conquest is the ancient city of Novgorod, the heart of the Novgorodian Confederation to our north. Having ultimately decided to forego diplomacy with the Novgorodians, we have sent insurgents across the border to attempt to lead a revolution under the guise of a pan-Russian rebellion in order to install a new regime friendly to our cause. Soon we shall know of their results, and whether we will have to openly intervene or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS115.A;Novgorod will be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS116.T;The Oath at the Holy Wisdom Cathedral;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS116.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has recently attempted to suborn our independence by sending over insurgents in an attempt to overthrow our government. Naturally the majority of them were intercepted before ever reaching the capital, but the fact that they would resort so such means has created fear everywhere that the whole of Russia might soon become subject to the tyrants in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Russian pan-nationalists everywhere call upon Novgorod to take up the mantle of Rurik and fulfil her destiny at unifying Russia. Even within $FROMCOUNTRY$ word reaches us of suppressed uprisings and demonstrations in favor of a Novgorodian-led Russian nation-state. This morning, on the steps of the Holy Wisdom Cathedral in the city of Novgorod, our generals and our soldiers pledged an oath to end the despotic government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ and unite the Russian nation under Novgorod much like Rurik did a millennium prior. After kneeling before the metropolitan and receiving his blessing, the armies of Novgorod departed the city and marched south to wage war for the soul of the Russian nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS116.A;We shall dethrone these tyrants and liberate Russia from their grasp!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS117.T;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$-Novgorodian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS117.D;The chaos that not long ago plagued the lands of the southern principalities has now reached the people of Novgorod. Already the drums of war sound over the horizon, signaling the arrival of war to the towns and villages that dot the lands of northern Russia. The fate of the entire Russian nation hangs on the outcome of this war. Will $COUNTRY$ unify all of Russia under its rule? Or will Novgorod succeed in asserting its independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS117.A;The final battle for the fate of all Russia has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS118.T;Victory over Novgorod!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS118.D;The armies of Novgorod have been defeated! After nearly a millennium of existence, the Novgorodian Confederation has been vanquished by its external enemies. In its place we have assumed direct control over the former lands of the confederation. The veche has been dissolved and a temporary administration over the city has been set up. There will be much reconciliation to be accomplished between former enemies but one thing remains certain: Russia is now united!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS118.A;And nevermore to be separated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS119.T;A Devastating Defeat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS119.D;Despite outnumbering the forces of Novgorod by a significant margin, our armies proved unable to leverage that advantage in the field. Long supply trains stretching through hostile lands, armies bogged down in the swamps of Novgorod, and attrition from the harsh Russian winter all ensured that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Grand Army remained just the opposite of that. What really won the war for Novgorod, however, was the defeat and capture of an 80,000 strong $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army by a Novgorodian force less than half its size. With such an embarrassing defeat and the subsequent capture of a prominent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general Novgorod has succeeded in forcing us to recognize their status as an independent nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS119.A;Is a unified Russia destined to remain no more than just a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS120.T;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$-Novgorodian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS120.D;Early this morning we received a communiqué from Novgorod declaring that a state of war now exists between us and the Novgorodian state. It was less than an hour before further reports started to flood in relating the loss of key positions along our northern border to the advancing armies of Novgorod. The bastards in Novgorod have struck first, and our forces are now in disarray! We must mobilize every man possible to drive back this treacherous enemy, for the fate of the entire nation -- nay, the soul of mother Russia herself -- lies on the line!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS120.A;The earth itself trembles as armies march across the fields of Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS121.T;The End of the Novgorodian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS121.D;After a long and bitter struggle, we have finally vanquished the treacherous armies of Novgorod. After surviving flood, fire, and enemy for nearly a millennium, it is us who has finally brought an end to the Novgorodian Confederation. With the downfall of Novgorod, the flame of Rurik now passes on to us as the true masters of the Russian nation! Much reconciliation will need to occur between both sides, but one thing remains certain: Russia stands unified under us, never again to be broken apart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS121.A;Russian unification is finally at hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS122.T;Novgorod Triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS122.D;For a thousand years our nation has stood and for a thousand years more shall we stand! The armies of the south have been decisively defeated! Against all odds we have come out victorious against our southern neighbor. While there will be much hardship to be had in the future as we rebuild Russia from the ground up, now is a time of jubilation! No longer shall foreigners speak of the Russian principalities in the plural, for now there exists only one Russian nation to speak of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS122.A;The flame of Rurik guides our path! Onwards to Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS123.T;An Uneasy Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS123.D;With both sides having exhausted themselves, diplomats from Novgorod and $COUNTRY$ have come together to negotiate the end of the war. Despite years of conflict, no decisive victory has been won by either side, and in the end what was supposed to be a war to decide the fate of Russia resulted in little more than some minor border changes. Neither side is satisfied with the result but both sides welcome the relief that peace has brought. Already, though, politicians from both sides are calling for the renewal of conflict, and have reasserted the right of each nation to rule over the other. What was ironically termed a treaty of perpetual peace now seems unlikely to last longer than a few years at most. There lies no doubt in anyone's mind that this conflict over the soul of the Russian nation will remain unresolved until one side ceases to exist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS123.A;The final battle for Russia has yet to end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.T;The Grand Principality Looks South;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.D;Not satisfied with just their hold over central Russia, the Grand Principality of Rus hungrily eyes the lands of the Cossacks to the south. While we would normally be ambivalent to the affairs of the Cossacks, the radical change in the geopolitical situation to our south has demanded our attention. This unified central Russian state poses a major threat to the sovereignty of Novgorod, and given how the Grand Principality of Rus has acted towards the Cossacks one can only imagine their ambitions towards us. It is imperative that we prepare to intervene against the ambitions of this new power in Russia, lest we find ourselves alone to face their might.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.A;Mobilize our forces, we must stand ready in the event that they act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS124.B;We are unconcerned with the affairs of a bunch of illiterate horseback riders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS125.T;Novgorod Takes Action;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS125.D;The unification of central Russia has been met with hostility on all sides. It seems the Novgorodians, discontent with the creation of our new state, have begun to act in order to dismember it piecemeal. All along our northern border Novgorodian troop movements have been observed, and word reaches us of a partial mobilization of the Novgorodian army for seemingly inexplicable reasons. If the Novgorodians continue with these acts of aggression we will be forced to act against them in order to preserve our sovereignty. However, we will open talks with the Novgorodians and see what, if anything, can be done to resolve the situation peacefully. Who knows, perhaps we may even be able to extend discussions to the issue of Russian unification?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS125.A;We must seek to resolve our differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS126.T;The Future of Russia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS126.D;Having noticed the recent movements of our armies, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us seeking to de-escalate the situation. As talks continued, however, the conversation slowly shifted from a simple detente to a discussion regarding the future of Russia. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has made it clear that they seek the complete unification of the Russian nation, which naturally includes our great confederation. In many ways we would likely stand to benefit in the event of the creation of a united Russia -- depending upon the form that this new nation would take. For now at least we shall remain receptive to what $FROMCOUNTRY$ has to say, at least until we can discern whether our images for a unified Russia are compatible or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS126.A;We shall listen to what they have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.T;Cossackia Rises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.D;To our north, the Novgorodians quarrel with the central Russians over who will lead the Russian nation. Little do either of them realize that the true soul of the Russian nation lies south, in the lands of the Cossacks! As the first Russian nation in centuries to truly live free from foreign enslavement, it is in Cossackia where the flame of Rurik burns brightest! It is our sacred duty to intervene in this war and assert our rightful place as hegemon of all Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.A;They shall know who the true masters of Russia are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS127.B;Perhaps we ought to remain out of this conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.T;The Invasion of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.D;For weeks now, forces from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been spotted amassing at the border. While it was initially believed that they were attempting to crack down on Cossack raids, it has quickly become clear that $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends to invade our nation and annex it to their own. However, we are not the weak and disorganized confederation that they believe us to be. We shall turn the tables on them, and as they have come for us so shall we subjugate them! We must mobilize every man available and strike at $FROMCOUNTRY$ before they can do the same to us, else we lose that independence which embodies the Cossack spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.A;These would-be oppressors wont know what hit em!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS129.B;Maybe they will leave us alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS128.T;The Great Trial for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS128.D;Sensing our vulnerability, the unified Cossack hordes of the south have launched a sneak attack on us in a desperate bid to seize the whole of Russia. With Novgorod attacking from the north and this new front opened up in the south, the Grand Principality of Rus is assailed by enemies on all sides. But no matter! This war for the livelihood and right to sovereignty of our entire nation has galvanized our people into resisting this onslaught. This is nothing less than the great trial thrust upon us by heaven through which all Russia will be baptized by fire! Our people shall rise up and overcome these hardships, forging a new nation from the ashes of our enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS128.A;Arise, men of Russia, and defend your motherland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRUS1290.T;The Month of Mourning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1290.D;The Princedom of Yaroslavl had been dragged into a medieval dynastic dispute that has resulted into a great loss of life and the further weakening of Yaroslavlian interests in Russia, for nothing. As the overly ambitious Nizhny Novgorod expedition of the Belsky prince ended in bitter failure, the princely family was also struck by disaster as a local smallpox edipedemic ended with Konstantin IV dead along with several of his grandsons. Many had hoped that the princes heir could reform and strengthen the state but Paul I ascended the throne in mourning, having lost both his father and his son in the incident and showed little interest in running the state, despite the crucial times. With the head of state retired in his dacha, the autocracy of Yaroslavl could not do anything. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS1290.A;Let us pray for those who left;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS130.T;Rise of the Zemstvo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS130.D;Paul's seclusion led to administrative chaos as the high centralisation wanted by his predecessors backfired due to the Prince's absenteeism. To fund the war, taxes had been raised and corruption had become rampant. The need for reform could not be ignored any further. Parallel institutions grew beside the official administration. In normal times, a Zemtsvo was a provincial assembly mostly made up of nobles and some rich burghers, but sometimes also representatives of serfs and free peasants. While on the outside they presented themselves as charities and cultural circles, offering minimal welfare to the poor, they were the hotbed of opposition to Belsky despotism. Following the Princes absence, the Zemtsva spruced up in all towns of the Princedom and began to act in place of the Princes agents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS130.A;What is going on in Yaroslavl ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.T;Return of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.D;Prince Paul eventually returned to the political scene after his mourning, with the intent of ruling his state. But he was much surprised by the new state of affairs, despite his new moderate yet still conservative stance. The damage to his authority was huge as the Zemstva had federalised and requested recognition as official institutions of local government. Prince Paul faced a choice : either accept this erosion of his prerogatives or attempt a bold move to deprive the Zemstva of their power. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.A;The Prince negotiates with the Zemtsvo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS131.B;The Prince takes action;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS132.T;The coup succeeds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS132.D;Paul found himself alone and without political support, and was therefore pressured to peacefully agree to sign his abdication without being humiliated. He retreated to one of his countryside mansions, without ever seeing again his son or brother or other members of his family and eventually died due to a firearm wound self-inflicted while trying to make rats flee his bedchamber. His son died of pneumonia, leading to the crowning of Dimitri III Belsky as Prince of Yaroslavl. \n \n He wiped away the Zemstva, persecuting its leaders with secret police and re-establishing the old absolute princely rule. Opposition moved underground and further radicalised, growing closer to marginal intellectual movements advocating emancipation and egalitarianism. The dispossession of many bourgeois, progressive land owners and proto-industrialists staled the princedom's economy, while the political paranoia and rampant reactionarism returned the judicial and administrative system to a paralysed semi-feudal level. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS132.A;Dimitri rules supreme!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS133.T;The coup backfires;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS133.D;The pro-coup faction was curbed by the opposition of Princess-Dowager Irene, despite her old age and attempts to cut her off from the court. A letter gave Paul a warning of the incoming coup attempt, allowing him to make the first move and save his throne. Prince Dimitri was imprisoned and many co-conspirators were executed for treason. \n \n Prince Paul co-opts new leaders from the administration and military from the most loyal and moderate members of the Zemstva, giving many middle-class members a chance to raise their societal status. The Zemstvo Union is hollowed out and the control of the princely commissioners becomes effective. Prince Paul must, however, accept some limitations to his absolute power and recognise the growing demand for modernisation, especially regarding the issue of serfdom. The Prince grants a small but meaningful constitution and announces the creation of a commission to plan full emancipation. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS133.A;The good ending ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS134.T;Anarchy on the Volga;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS134.D;Prince Paul and his sons are brutally killed after resisting the proposal of voluntary abdication and the forced removal on the grounds of insanity. Feeling responsible for the action of the rogue troop, Dimitri refuses the crown despite the acclamation by the reactionary faction. /n /n Sensing the collapse of princely authority, the Zemstvo Union coordinates loyalist troops and crushes the reactionary coup. Under the leadership of major romanticist writer Nikolai Druzhinin, the radical intellectuals and the nobles opposing the return in all forms of Belsky despotism joined forces and drafted a constitution loosely based on the Novgorodian customs. The new High Volga Council accepts the formal sovereignty of the Metropolitan of Tver, while a new complicated hierarchy of Zemstva from the village to the national level exercises political power in the most byzantine way imaginable. \n \n The chaos is absolute and some regions rule themselves in almost complete autonomy from Yaroslavl while remnants of the Belsky family raise militias roaming the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS134.A;A Republic at all costs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS135.T;The Rostov Edicts backfire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS135.D;Despite the jubilation of the intellectuals, the reaction to the edicts was poor. The serfs, sensing their transformation into individually taxable citizens, feared the loss of collective Mir responsibility, which safeguarded their right to land and house in face of the ever-hungry tax collectors. While emancipation had been silently longed for centuries many did not see the difference between what life would have been before and after. \n \n The Prince attempted to save the situation by strengthening the Mir assemblies and giving them the opportunity to choose communal property and repartition of land, but attacks against government officials checking the emancipation progress became frequent alongside tax dodging. Then the Miry effectively allied with the Zemstva, which offered increasingly tempting services while preserving the old social order. Prince Paul was forced to temporarily, then permanently, stop the reform without even attempting to expand it to boyar-owned serfs. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS135.A;They dont know what is good for them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS136.T;The Rostov Edicts work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS136.D;After some hesitation, the Mir assemblies cautiously took the clearly historical step requested by their sovereign. The reform did not fully modernise the way the rural world worked, but already a few months after the Edicts it became clear that things had started to move. \n \n Tensions rose to the highest level when full Emancipation was proclaimed by Prince Paul, including private-owned serfs. The step was probably taken too early and while the boyars were economically crippled they still had the capabilities to oppose this decision. The "court" and the Prince became distant and hostile as the autocrat felt the full burden of despotism and the responsibility of his gamble. The private-owned muzhiks weren't given enough land and the price they had to pay to their former owners was much higher than the tariff asked to state-owned serfs. Nobles and peasants rattled their sabres, but the Prince cautiously integrated new landowners into the Zemstva and the administration, suppressing the oppositions. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS136.A;Divine rule gets things done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS137.T;The Rostov Edicts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS137.D;Prince Paul tried to gain time: most of the boyars of the Zemstva were deeply in debt, usually with state-owned banks, which meant they lacked effective control over them as a growing percentage is mortgaged to support their lifestyle. By gaining political power at the expense of the prince they hope to secure their status by emptying the coffers of the State, turning Yaroslavl into a paralysed and isolationist noble republic like Ryazan and the Commonwealth. \n \n Keeping faith to the unbroken alliance with his people, the Prince knew it was his to duty to guide all his subjects towards a better future. Thus he promulgated the Rostov Edicts which ordered the immediate emancipation of all state-owned serfs. The most important measure is the new power of the Mir (village) assemblies of former state Muzhiks to divide a generous percentage of the land under their jurisdiction between the peasant households, based on family size. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS137.A;The Prince knows what is good for his subjects!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS138.T;The Prince's gambit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS138.D;Prince Paul attempted to gain the reins of the Zemstva by imposing the tutelage of a Prince-appointed commissioner and by making some of the welfare activities offered by the Zemstva a service offered by the state. But administrative efficiency remained low and the new competences taken from the Zemstva make it even harder for the state to administrate. It led to growing hatred toward the Prince among the lowest class, which had had hopes for better standards of living thanks to these services. Discontent also grew in the Belsky family, as cousins and brothers of Paul became convinced that he had become irreparably unfit for rule after the death of his son and his actions were destroying the legitimate authority in Yaroslavl. Dimitri, Paul's brother, was asked by reactionary generals and nobles to lead a coup to imprison and depose his brother and become regent for the young Alexey, Paul's son. Dimitri accepted but the divisions within the Belsky family make the coup attempt less smooth than expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

#CRUS76.T;The vision of Mikhail;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS76.D;Michael II Repnin has managed to bring back Ryazan to power and unify the Central Russian Lands as no ruler has ever done in the history of Russia. Curtailing the Boyars? powers, their rich estates are now worked in the name of the state. The rich lands of the South now feed the ever growing population of the Grand Principality. With soldiers loyal to him and his ideals of a Russia master of the steppe and thus her destiny, he now turns his eyes south to the Cossack and Tatar lands in which he will forge a new nation upon the ashes of her old enemies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS76.A;For Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.T;The realm of the Boyars;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.D;The Boyars of Ryazan have withstood the problems caused by Michael II Repnin and held on their prerogatives in power. In the wars that followed, Ryazan emerged victorious, the Duma now becoming the main power responsible for Central Russia. Serfdom still is an important piece of the nation, and it has been used to fuel unprecedented population growth thanks to the rich lands from the South that the peasants from all Russia will now toil in. The aristocracy that guides the new unified Prince of the Rus knows where its interests lie. It is not in Northern Russia, filled with radicals and idealists that the Russian nation will be forged, but in the open lands of the South where lands only demand for the boyars to come and exploit them! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS77.A;For the true nobility!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.T;The expansion of the Union;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.D;The Vozhd of Smolensk rules over the unified Union of Muscovy, contemplating the efforts done in the former years. Inefficient rule of the Assemblies has been sidelined as Smolensk and the whole of Russia needed a strong but benevolent hand. And who but to lead the rising Russian nation but the Vozhd of the People ? Soldiers have been sent to educate the former serfs who are now armed to vanquish the foes of the Vozhd. Boyar rule has ended in central Russia but it is not enough. For the true Slavic nation to appear, blood will need to be spilled as the archaic and free Northerners and Cossacks must be subjugated and learn true Russian Narodnost !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS78.A;We follow the Vozhd!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS79.T;Russian Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS79.D;The Smolenskan Confederation that emerged from the independence has survived and achieved a transition into a Muscovite Confederation ruling over all of Central Russia. Many sought to extinguish the light that emerged in the West, preferring to keep the masses in serfdom and ignorance. But our Republic knows better, it is the era of the masses and we hear the lamentations from our cousins in the North and South who look up to us to realize the ideals of Freedom and Equality in the lands of the Rus. The road ahead will be tough, but a new Nation shall arise, one that will not repeat the mistakes of the past and unify the Slavic people of the East under one flag and one rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

#CRUS80.D;The enlightened rule of the Prince of Smolensk and his advisors in the Duma has maintained balance between the ideals of the West and the traditions from Russia. Only Smolensk could modernize Russia without upsetting what made the Russian identity. Masses are now being enlightened by their betters as it should be and while the worst Boyars have been deprived of their powers, all recognize the necessary role of the aristocracy in guiding the Grand Principality. Now the armies of the Rus must march once again to forge a new Slavic Nation in the East, against the unruly Cossacks and the archaic Novgorodians !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS80.A;Modernity will not sweep all traditions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.T;The Tsarina looks South;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.D;The Grand Principality of Rus has emerged from the ashes of the old dynastic conflicts of Nizhny Novgorod. The grand princess Anna Lyapunova now rules alone over Central Russia, having reconquered her home and beyond while reforming the lands she holds. Boyars are now curtailed by the ever-growing state apparatus while the masses celebrate the ?tsarina?, a title evocating the brief rule of Ivan III and Zoe Palaiologos with whom the Princess has cultivated various ties. With her position secured and the support of the Russian people, Anna looks east and south across the steppes to acquire the land necessary to forge a new nation that could rise to the occasion and become a leading power in the East. Soon the glory of the Tsarina will be discussed over all Europe and all the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS81.A;Long live Anna 'The Mother of Russia'!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.T;The Bear on the march;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.D;The Union of Muscovy has emerged from the ashes of the old dynastic conflicts of Nizhny Novgorod, with the Generallisimo Talantsev at her helm. The general has won over the support of the masses of whole Central Russia despite his foreign origins and lowly rank. The old hierarchies have been swept away as the Talantsev squadrons began to apply the new order across the Union. It is time now to look further than the current borders : the Volga has been the blood of Nizhny Novgorod for all its existence and shall become along with the Don the source of the new Russian Nation, as the Tatars are pacified and the lands christianized under the helm of the greatest conqueror the Russians have ever known! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
#CRUS82.A;Long live Talantsev! For a more glorious Union!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

#CRUS83.D;Konstantin IV of Iaroslav has vanquished his enemies and reclaimed the legacies of Ivan III, Dimitri I and Feodor II ! An autocrat now rules over the unified Grand Principality of Rus, and never has it been such needed ! The nobility and the clergy needed to be reminded of their subservience to their sovereign while the masses had grown desperate at the hands of unworthy masters. Now the Autocrat sees all and balances the needs of the states justly. But it is only the beginning : soon a new nation will rise from the ashes of the old Russia and it only needs to bend the old Republic of Novgorod to the command of Konstantin to truly rule all the Russias. Then the Russian Crown shall look further west and south to begin the new power of Europe and Asia under the benevolent rule of the only one legitimate sovereign !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

CRUS150.T;The Polish Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS150.D;Now that the wars have ended and Moscow has reunited the old Grand-Duchy of Vladimir and Muscovy, the place of Stanislaw Habsburg has only strengthened. His role in the war, notably his success in leading the charge that gave the final victory over the Belskys of Yaroslavl have made him popular with the soldiery, and he has been given a lavish palace who belonged to the Prince of Nizhny Novgorod as a reward. However, his Liberal stance and his criticism of the Boyars rule have attracted him many enemies in court. Moreover, he has not abandoned his Catholic faith and has already clashed with the Patriarch of Moscow several times. Already a pamphlet has been issued anonymously, calling him a Trojan horse of Poland, and calling for all faithful Russians to remember the damage the Polish kings brought during the Smuta. The Grand-Prince has already censored the work but many wonder what place Stanislaw will occupy in the new Russia that is being made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS150.A;He is a national hero for Gods sake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS151.T;A Threat from Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS151.D;The escape and then subsequent banishment of Stanislaw Habsburg from Poland was seen by most of the Sejm as the most logical course of action. When they heard he had fled to his brother-in-law in Moscow, most thought theyd never hear of him again. But news from his actions during the Muscovite Wars have been the main focus of many newspapers in Warsaw and the rest of the Commonwealth, notably his heroic charge against the Prince of Yaroslavl. Now the Sejm grows alarmed : Moscow has united and seeks to unite Russia, a country that wishes to take our lands and people. With Stanislaw at the helm of their armies, who knows what the radicals could do ? Already people discuss a possible split of the Commonwealth between Stanislaw and his brother-in-law and that has made even the most reluctant members of the Sejm agree to rally against our new neighbour : We shall ask them to banish Stanislaw and give back any land that belonged to the Commonwealth, notably Smolensk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS152.T;The Commonwealth Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS152.D;To the utter astonishment of our entire government, the Commonwealth has become so overwhelmed by its own arrogance that it has seen fit to deliver a demand to us : hand Stanislaw and Smolensk over to them, or face war! From our spies in their nation, it seems that the specter of Stanislaw leading a Muscovite army into the Commonwealth has become too agonizing for them to bear, and so it has driven them to this act of incredible rashness. Our cabinet is almost unanimous in agreeing that to obey this directive would be an intolerable humiliation, yet can we afford to face war when Russia is still not yet unified? We have still not healed from the wars by which Great Russia was united. To face the Commonwealth now, with the question of the north still unanswered, could jeopardize our entire program of Russian unification. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS153.D;While we had anticipated a lack of cooperation from the Muscovites, few of us ever expected them to reply with such laconic conciseness. A messenger from Muscovy arrived before the Sejm and made a grand display of flourishing a letter replying to our ultimatum, sealed with the sign of the Muscovite ruler, and then addressed him by his long, formal, ostentatious title. However, once the letter was finally unsealed and read, the entire Sejm was astounded at its contents : merely a single word, No! At this point the Sejm burst into outrage, with hundreds of nobles demanding the messenger be seized and brutalized for the insult. While several soldiers intervened and escorted the messenger away  for immediate deportation  much of the Sejm is furious that the Muscovites would not only defy us but do so in such a flippant and petulant manner. For the first time in memory, the Sejms opinion is united : war with Muscovy is the only way to recover our honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With our armies shattered in the field and the government in chaos, Stanislaw was rooted out of hiding and brought back to the Commonwealth for whatever dark fate they have planned for him. Already the Commonwealth is laying out the peace terms they seek to impose upon us, each one another dagger into our chest. As our domestic politics inch closer and closer to the abyss, the first flames of a political explosion beginning to flare up, many of our people wonder : has all of our work been for nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the peoples of both our nation and theirs turn with newly critical eyes towards their rulers, who drove them to sacrifice so much on their behalf, the halls of power in Warsaw and Moscow are filled with fear for the future.

With our forces broken and the government in chaos, the Sejms resolve quickly faltered and they hurriedly agreed to a long list of Muscovite demands simply to save their own hides. The nation lies burning, as the nobles have once more covered their assets by throwing the country to the wolves at the door. Already news is spreading of the peace terms which the Sejm consented to in order to halt the Muscovite march, each one another knife in our backs. Is this the beginning of the Commonwealths end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS155.A;Perhaps this union was not meant to endure after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS156.T;Anarchy in Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS156.D;The loss of not only Stanislaw, but the entirety of Smolensk, to the Commonwealth has plunged the nation into a level of disorder not seen since the Time of Troubles. Wild-eyed prophets roam the countryside, proclaiming the end of days, while furious boyars denounce the Tsar with a bitterness that wouldve been seen as blasphemy before this crisis began. The chief critic is none other than the Patriarch of Moscow himself, who has begun to question the Tsars very fitness to rule! Worse, news is spreading of efforts by several influential boyars to build support for an aristocratic coup against the Tsar. If we want to halt this crisis, extreme measures are needed. Two radical suggestions have been put forward by the Tsars advisors : either convert to Unitarianism  which would, at least, deprive the Patriarch of his authority over the Tsars government  or organize a massive payout of bribes to the most powerful boyars of the nation. What shall be done to save Muscovy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS156.A;May Vladimir forgive us, for we must forsake his will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS156.T;Boyars are greedy men, gold shall satisfy them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS157.T;The Patriarch's Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS157.D;Our efforts to thwart the mobilization of the clergy and the boyars against the Tsar have failed. With public animosity towards the throne finally boiling over, the charismatic and reactionary Patriarch Dmitry of Moscow has decided to take matters into his own hands. A coalition of boyars led an army into Moscow late last night, overpowering the city guards and heading straight to the Moscow Kremlin. Quickly fighting their way inside, they escorted Patriarch Dmitry into the bedroom of the Tsar. Dmitry then anathematized the Tsar for his degradation of Muscovy, his grievous injuries to the Russian people, and his failures to uphold, honor, and obey the will of the Most Holy God. The anathematized Tsar was dragged to a hastily convened Zemsky Sobor within the Kremlins walls, in which the Tsar was officially deposed, and Patriarch Dmitry coronated Dmitry I of the Holy Muscovite Patriarchate. The Tsar may have failed the Russian people, but Patriarch Dmitry, backed by the boyars and guided by God, shall not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS157.A;Slava Dmitry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS158.T;Continued Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS158.D;It seems that not even Patriarch Dmitry could bring instantaneous stability to Muscovy. The disestablishment of the monarchy has greatly aggravated the situation of the countryside. Rural villages, whom the clergy have told for generations that the monarch was Gods primary agent on Earth, have reacted poorly to the news that Gods will shall now be executed by the Patriarch instead. Many have begun to withhold taxes, to the point of violently attacking army units sent to escort tax collectors. Worse, certain religious cults are cropping up as people slander the holy name of Dmitry and accuse him of perverting the will of God! But both problems pale in comparison to the reaction of urban elites and intelligentsia, who have denounced the Patriarch and his seizure of power with unrestrained fury. Cities across the nation have become hotbeds of resistance, with protests and even small riots practically a daily occurrence. The situation is only growing worse with each passing day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS158.A;"Yet though I walk in the shadow of the valley of death...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS159.T;An Uneasy Calm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS159.D;So far, it appears that Patriarch Dmitrys swift removal of the Tsar has thrown the opponents of the regime into confusion. Unable to coordinate their opposition, resistance has been limited to various isolated incidents. Yet this may be merely the calm before the storm, as our domestic patrols indicate that unrest may be rising in both the cities and the countryside. For now it seems that all we can do is wait and hope that Muscovy shall finally know peace once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS159.A;Whatever happens, God shall provide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS160.T;Protests in Every City!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS160.D;Our worst fears have been confirmed : the calm of the last few weeks was illusory. Over the past few days, liberals and dissatisfied boyars have ignited protests across Muscovy. In almost every major city, crowds have marched through the streets, shouting their denunciation of the government and its failure to address their needs or find an effective foreign policy. Not only have the urban elite stirred their followers up, but even in the countryside, rural communities have begun to fortify their villages, as peasant collectives begin to become more and more like armed camps. Collecting taxes has now gained the occupational hazard of rifle fire from defiant peasants. Law and order is on the verge of breaking down in Muscovy, and there are really only two options if Dmitry wants to maintain power : call out the army and lock down the nation, or gamble his popularity on a massive campaign to unite Russia by fire and sword. If he succeeds in the latter, his name shall be blazed into the heavens. If he fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS160.A;Cloister the country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS160.B;Commence the Crusade for Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS161.T;The Russian Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS161.D;Dmitry, Patriarch of Moscow and now ruler of Muscovy, has seen his popularity erode precipitously over the last few weeks. With protests sweeping the nation, he has decided to wage one last desperate campaign to bring all of what he considers the natural lands of Russia under his rule. Muscovite armies are now bearing down upon us, and we must make ready to defend ourselves from these mad legions of fanatics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS161.A;If they seek martyrdom, then we are happy to oblige!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS162.T;The Great Russian Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS162.D;With the holy armies of Muscovy now fully assembled, Patriarch Dmitry has given them a benediction. Loyal sons of Muscovy, sons of Russia, faithful men of God! Before us lies the land of our ancestors, the primordial earth of the Rus, where our forefathers forged a mighty nation. Yet mighty as she was, her sons did not preserve her, and so squandered their inheritance. For ages, Russia has laid sleeping, unaware of her childrens condition. But now, Russia stirs! She awakes to find herself in the light of God, her strength returning to her. As she draws her sword, she is not alone. She marches to battle with every man and woman in Muscovy who keeps the love of God and the glory of His son, Jesus Christ, in their hearts! The Patriarch makes a sweep with his hand, towards the horizon. There, my sons, lies Russia! There lies this ancient, long-slumbering land, this realm of warriors that yearns for one nation, one faith. In the name of most holy God, I implore you : be the instruments of her salvation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS162.A;AMEN! §R(DECLARE WAR ON ALL RUSSIAN AND TATAR STATES)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS163.T;Holy Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS163.D;When Patriarch Dmitry declared the Great Russian Crusade, a few blasphemous fools dared to question his wisdom, claiming that God would not protect us as he has done for ages. Once again, however, the doubters have been shamed and shown the error of their ways, and Gods will has triumphed. All of Russia is now under Muscovite hegemony, and the road to unification has never been clearer. Throughout the land  throughout all Russian lands  people are beginning to finally understand Patriarch Dmitrys role as Gods foremost messenger, and pay him the praise which has been so long overdue. With Russian unity now only a matter of time, the faithful may rest assured that Russia shall retain its holy Christian character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS163.A;God truly was and is with us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS164.T;The Destiny of Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS164.D;When Patriarch Dmitry declared the Great Russian Crusade, most thought him mad, and saw the war as nothing more than the last desperate act of a power-hungry tyrant. It seems, however, that fate found it a more delicious cruelty to humor his delusions by granting him victory. With the hordes of zealous Muscovites rampaging through our lands, the issue of our place within the future Russian order has, apparently, already been determined. Our only hope is that they shall prove more benevolent masters in peace than in war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS164.A;God help us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS165.T;The End of Muscovy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS165.D;The clocks of Moscow all strike midnight, as a messenger dashes through the city gates. Weaving past rows of field hospitals, through alleys full of tense soldiers, he proceeds to the Kremlin, a dire message in hand. Finally receiving admittance, he approaches the monarchs quarters to deliver the news : the last Muscovite army has been broken. But, he does not deliver his message  there is nobody to deliver it to. God has called the leader of Muscovy home, and he lies dead, sprawled upon the floor, his Bible still open to the Book of Revelations. /n/n The end of our national stability, and the news of sovereigns death, has spelled the collapse of Muscovy. Boyars have given up on the central government and contacted local generals to declare their own petty realms. As foreign powers swoop in upon the Muscovite corpse, the conclusion of nearly all observers is that Muscovy has lost any chance of unifying Russia. Time will tell if another state will take up the task but for the time being, Russia is lost once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS165.A;Life, a series of increasing sufferings, flies further and further towards its endthe most terrible suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS166.T;Muscovy Shattered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS166.D;Muscovy as we knew it is no more. All of the lands which it claimed in its quest to unify Russia have broken away, steered onto new courses by ambitious boyars and generals. Perhaps we shall write the next chapter of Russia's history?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS166.A;Total freedom, with all the horror it entails.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS167.T;Peace Returns to Muscovy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS167.D;The dire prophecies of pessimists both foreign and domestic have failed to be born out, as the Muscovite ship of state once more crests the waves. Protests have begun to fade into minor complaints, the peasants have returned to their work, and the boyars have accepted the new order. Yet while collapse has been averted, the future of the nation is still unclear. Some believe that Dmitrys best bet to ensure long-term stability is to reconcile with right-wing members of the Lyapunovs, crowning a suitably pious conservative as the new Tsar and returning to spiritual duties. Others believe that the radical cause has merely gone underground, and is in fact poised to strike at the heart of Muscovite power and seize control. Still others hold that Muscovys future lies in building consensus and establishing a balance of power between the estates. Finally, hardcore Orthodox Christians encourage Dmitry to maintain his position as head of state. In the end;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS167.A;...Prince Konstantin Lyapunov is crowned Tsar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS167.B;...a republican coup is executed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRUS168.T;The Patriotic War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS168.D;The Commonwealth has finally managed to overcome all political obstacles and centralize itself into a modern nation state. While this would be problematic enough for our foreign policy, they have not contented themselves with organizing their domestic politics, but have pursued an ambitious and aggressive policy abroad. This has now been taken to the most dire extreme, as the Commonwealth has declared that the situation in Muscovy is no longer acceptable, and have proclaimed their intent to reorganize the region through nothing less than a campaign of brutal subjugation! Already the Commonwealths legions are marching towards us, hellbent on shattering our nation and ending the threat of Russian unification. As the hoofbeats of their winged hussars begin to echo in the ears of our border guards, Muscovy faces its darkest hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS168.A;We shall fight for the future and destroy these invaders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS169.T;Victory in the Patriotic War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS169.D;To the joy and relief of all true Russians, the vile Commonwealths invasion of Muscovy has been destroyed! They fought with the strength of devils, but this was not enough to overcome the indomitable Muscovite spirit, nor the power of our valiant soldiers. This victory shall surely further our reputation as the rightful unifiers of Russia, and draw outlying states to our cause. The Commonwealth may have thought itself newly invincible but we have revealed their weakness, and soon enough, once the Russian people are united, we shall repay them - with interest. Long live Muscovy, long live free Russia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CRUS169.A;May our light shine in glory for all Russians to see!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
##################### THE GIGANTIC BLOB OF NOVOGROD LOCALIZATION. GOD HELP EVERYONE. ##############################;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS1.T;Lord Novgorod the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS1.D;Novgorod is a confederation of various states, princedoms, and republics swearing fealty to "Lord Novgorod the Great", that is the city of Veliky Novgorod and its institutions. These institutions are made of three entities: the prince, the Council of Lords and the Great Veche, which is a public assembly led by the Posadnik, the mayor of Novgorod. The Republic has suffered a terrible blow with the loss of the Republic of Pskov, reorganized as a Scandinavian satellite state following the Neva War that ended in 1709. In 1836 the Republic is at a crossroad: It must centralize and reform its institutions, which would anger the princedoms and republics within its borders who rely on ancient privileges. It must deal with the ambiguous status of serfdom, as the southern Russian states are angered by the protection offered to freed serfs. Will Novgorod wear the mantle of Alexander Nevsky and lead Russia towards a new era, perish under the Scandinavian boot, or suffocate by its byzantine politics?;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS1.A;For Novgorod the Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.T;The Uralic petition;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.D;The Vyatka Republic is a constituent member of the Novgorod confederation, but many of its inhabitants are not Slavs but Uralic people who are discriminated against by various Russian laws. Vyatka is a peculiar case of political integration, as Udmurt, Mari and Komi people live within its borders and enjoy a certain degree of citizenship rights. However, They are still treated as second-class citizens, despite their almost complete conversion to Orthodoxy. The Uralic people of the republic have petitioned the local Veche to abolish some long standing norms like discriminatory legislation for land ownership and military conscription. The spokesman of this group is Yevgeny Blinov, a russified Udmurt noble and patron of the first Udmurt publishing house, his wealth has attracted many Vyatkan officials to his side.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.A;Vyatka will recognize the rights of its loyal citizens;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS2.B;This is a Slavic Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.T;Fate of the Mari Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.D;The Mari Confederation is situated in the no-man's-land between Tatary, the Novgorodian Confederation and central Russia. The Mari have fiercely fought against both Russian and Tatars, resisting attempts at conquest, colonization and conversion. There is no clear centralized administration in the area, but numerous tribe leaders have already converted to Orthodoxy and have made trade relations with Vyatkan their main source of wealth and power. When news came that Vyatka expanded the rights of the Uralic people living within its borders, including some northern Mari tribes, many chieftains wondered if they would not be better off joining Vyatka, and Novgorod as a whole or keep their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS3.A;Join Vyatka!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS4.A;Let them join!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.T;The conscription law;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS5.D;The news of the integration of Uralic peoples in the Vyatkan Republic has created a negative reaction in Novgorod. While Karelians and other Finnic minorities are tolerated, the farther east one goes the more hostility towards Uralic people grows. The economy of the North greatly benefits from the yearly fur tax, the yasak, demanded from Samoyedic and Komi tribes. Political integration would mean losing this lucrative tax and challenge the colonial attitude some colonists harbor towards the Uralic people. The northern volosts have asked the Veche how to deal with this large minority who have heard of the new Vyatkan laws. A new conscription law is proposed as a replacement for the yasak, which would establish Komi and Nenets units as military reserves and assistants for frontier outposts and isolated garrisons. Tyko Verigin, a representative of Samoyedic origin from the volost of Arkhangelsk, also proposes to give Uralic chieftains and elders the right to join local administrative assemblies, giving them a voice in the administration of their land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS5.C;Rights are granted to the Uralics;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.T;News from Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.D;Our new laws of integration for the Uralic peoples have created quite a stir in Novgorod, for the Veche has reaffirmed the discriminatory laws that we abolished. While autonomous, we still bow to Lord Novgorod the Great and keeping our laws could be poorly seen in the capital. On the other hand, it would be easy enough to write a sham law that would appease the republic while keeping the rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.A;We bow to our Lord of course;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS6.B;Our rewriting means nothing, we assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.T;Udmurt unrest;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.D; Our refusal to grant rights to the Uralic people have created unrest within our small republic. The Udmurts and Mari living in Vyatka have started to resent the increasing discrimination caused by the harsh rejection of Blinov's proposals and strange rumors come from their territories, talking of seditions and troubles to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS7.A;They can revolt. We are stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.T;Blinov's insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.D;The Udmurts have declared independence under the guidance of Blinov! A Confederation similar to the Mari has been  formed, with a political structure based on the democratic institutions of Vyatka. At the same time, the Udmurts reject envoys from Vyatka and have started harassing Russian garrisons. Many Russians in the countryside are escaping north or west, although those living in urban centers have been granted full rights. Vyatka must rally the various garrisons and march East to avoid a complete collapse of their authority in the hinterlands. Envoys have also been sent to Novgorod to ensure we get reinforcements;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS8.A;Pesky Udmurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.T;News from Vyatka;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.D;Worrying news has reached us from our subjects in Vyatka. The small republic is facing an insurrection launched by the Udmurt tribes, who have grown resentful of the discrimination they face in their lands. They ask us for our support in quelling the rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.A;We will march against the Udmurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS9.B;It is too costly to commit troops;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.T;War in Udmurtia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.D;The War against the Udmurts has been raging for several weeks already, and many fear that the Vyatkans arent strong enough to take care of this threat on their own. Following a rowdy session in the Veche and Council of Lords, it has been decided to send several regiments to the East to end the troubles and secure our trade again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS10.A;The forests will burn if needed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.T;Defeat in the Votyak War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.D;As the Udmurts have secured their territory and defeated the platoons sent to defeat them, the Novgorodian Republic has been forced to recognize their independence to avoid any more financial losses. The defeat in the Votyak War proves the disastrous condition of the Novgorodian army and the administrative chaos of the confederation, which couldn't resist the uprising of mere disgruntled peasants. Valuable territory has been lost and communication with the Ural territories has become more difficult, as Novgorodians envoys and merchants must circumvent Udmurt territory to avoid customs or harassment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS11.A;What has happened to us...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.T;Victory in the Votyak war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.D;The Udmurts have been vanquished and their territory has been reintegrated into the republic. The end of the Votyak War proved that Novgorod still has an army capable of ensuring control of the confederation's territory, although many still doubt the capability of its leaders in the case of an actual conflict. The exile of Yevgeny Blinov and the closure of his publishing house has radicalised the few Uralic intellectuals, which along with rogue chieftains continued to stir unrest in the region long after the end of the uprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS12.A;Nonetheless, its a victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS13.T;Fate of Vyatka;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS13.D;Novgorod must decide what to do with Vyatka. The Vyatkan Veche has been replaced by a military authority, people flee westward and the economy is in shambles. Routes towards Siberia move northwards outside the territory of the Republic, the Vyatka river is too dangerous to navigate and the ironworks facilities are either in Udmurt territory or are being dismantled to be rebuilt in the Urals, where now they are more profitable. Two options are proposed: Vyatka would be reorganised under a military government becoming a stronghold against the attacks coming from the Tatars and the Uralic tribes or the Vyatkan Veche would be restored as before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS16.D;I went silent as this nobleman praised the institution of serfdom and the lack of worries the serfs enjoy. The serf is the happiest man in Russia he told me. But I thought, as they do not feel worries, they can not possess families, feel affection, happiness or grasp other moral sentiments. They possess nothing, not even their life, and thus any of the natural rights that were unearthed after centuries of despotism by our philosophers /n /n The son of a Novgorodian merchant in the Russian quarter of Copenhagen, Leonid Vorontsov, has published in Copenhagen a fictionalised voyage diary of a trip from Nyenschantz to Vologda based on his own first visit to his motherland, describing the inhuman living conditions of the Russian serfs. His work widely translated has also started again the debate on serfdom in Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS16.A;At least this book is only sold abroad!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.T;The Serfdom debate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.D;Novgorod is a collection of different political entities that have different legislations, especially regarding serfdom. Some countries or regions don't have it, like Yugra or the Pomor lands. Some have normal serfdom, like Novgorods core territory, and some have a very conservative and harsh serfdom similar to the southern princedoms, like Galich and Beloozero. There has been no major evolution in serfdom legislation for at least fifty years, but the percentage of serfs has been steadily increasing, as is the number of escapees to free territories.The debate launched by Vorontsovs book has led to the abolitionists clamoring for the Veche and Council of Lords to take a stance on the matter. The main problem comes from the stark opposition between the Council of the Lords that oppose any law proposal, and the leader of the Veche, the Posadnik, Konstantin Levashov who has decided to push for an harsher abolitionist stance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS17.A;Let them debate!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.T;The first draft;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.D;The Veche has debated for several days the idea of a unified Muzhikate Code that would make the laws of the city of Novgorod concerning serfdom effective throughout the entire Confederation. Widely seen as a compromise as it doesnt abolish serfdom and even could restrict some freedoms enjoyed in the northern territories or volotsks, it has drawn the opposition of the Posadnik who wants the Muzhikate Code to be amended by restoring old laws, especially the tradition that allowed serfs to leave their masters on the day of Saint Yuri. Regardless of the amendment, the law will go to the Council of Lords, that will oppose any form of Muzhikate Code.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.A;The first draft it is;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS18.B;Draft the amendment into the Code.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.T;The Muzhikate Code is adopted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.D;The Muzhikate Code proposed by the Veche has been accepted by the Council of Lords despite its members relying on serfdom for their wealth and position. Many believe this outcome to result from popular discontent towards serfdom along with the realization by some noblemen that gradual reform is better if they hope to keep power in the long run. Nonetheless, this law, while quite minor, will better the lives of the serfs in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS19.A;A small step;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.T;The Levashov Code is adopted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.D;To the surprise of many, the Muzhikate Code proposed by the Veche and amended at the demand of the Posadnik has passed through the Council of Lords. No one really knows how the game was played, or the reasons behind it, but rumours talk about how the Posadnik would have bribed and threatened the members of the Council thanks to citizen bands loyal to him. While the law will improve the status of serfs in the confederation, this move has greatly angered the boyars and the princes of Beloozero and Galich who now begin to scheme together and fragment the Republic even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS20.A;A victory, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.T;Veto from the Nobles;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.D;While the Boyars of Novgorod do not possess a power as great as the Slazchta in the Commonwealth, the Council of Lords can veto proposals from the Veche. Unsurprisingly, the draft demanding better living conditions for the serfs has been refused. While crowds have gathered to voice their anger towards the boyars leaving the Yaroslavl palace, there isnt much that can be done to revert their decision. Only one person can act: the prince, but many fear that his senility will lead to the same result or worse. The law can also be abandoned: abolitionism while an important political debate in Novgorod is not shared enough amongst the wealthy and educated to be worth basing a political career on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.A;Postpone any further debates;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS21.B;Ask the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.T;The refusal of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.D;Simeon Yemin was already old when he was elected to be Prince of Novgorod. But as years go by, his role, already weak in the political circles of Novgorod, has become one of a symbolic figure that appears in front of crowds, presides over some ceremonies and signs the necessary papers from his seat in the Yaroslavl palace in the centre of the city. Many claim the old man is insane or senile, while the ones who are close to him say that it is a façade he has built over the years to be tranquil. No matter what the truth is, the Veche's representatives have regretted asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The Prince refused to overrule the decision of the Lords and then shouted at the Posadnik that he had interrupted his afternoon rest. With this peculiar event, the hopes of the abolitionists have been crushed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS22.A;Damn the old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS23.T;The Most Glorious Code!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS23.D;Simeon Yemin was already old when he was elected to be Prince of Novgorod. But as years go by, his role, already weak in the political circles of Novgorod, has become one of a symbolic figure that appears in front of crowds, presides over some ceremonies and signs the necessary papers from his seat in the Yaroslavl palace in the centre of the city. Many claim the old man is insane or senile, while the ones who are close to him say that it is a façade he has built over the years to be tranquil. No matter what the truth is, the Veches representatives have been surprised by the prince after asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The Prince not only accepted to overrule the decision of the Lords. He promulgated the Code with the Amendment, and praised the text to be the Most Glorious Code of the Republic. The nobles heavily criticized the prince, as many saw it as another proof of his lunacy and his influenceable state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS23.A;The old man can be useful sometimes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

No matter what the truth is, the Veches representatives have been surprised by the prince after asking him to pass the Muzhikate Code. The prince agreed to overrule the decision of the Lords if the text said that the law was passed on his initiative. While discontent with this state, nobles hardly could express anger as this was seen as one of the strange acts the prince performed and made him quite popular by many in the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS24.A;Glory to the Prince, I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.T;A speech at the university;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.D;For the hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Novgorodian University, the President of the Fur Traders Guild Artemy Trediakovsky was invited for a speech. The Fur Traders Guild has been a major philanthropic and political association involved in all kinds of cultural and economical affairs for decades. Fur trade is now only one of the many economic activities of the guild, whose main focus has become the promotion of modern industrial culture and the opening of the Republic to the West. He talked for an hour and proclaimed that the city of Novgorod was the door to the West for all of Russia and that the right path for the Republic was the "enlightening marvels along the Narva''. He condemned the "mirages of the ancient times", that only had to offer "another thousand years of toiling" for Russian peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS25.A;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.T;Meanwhile in the Ural...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.D;On the other side of the country, far away from the comforts of the city, the Yugrian Confederation administers the lands of the eastern frontier. A federation of Cossack hosts, monastic communes, fortified villages and barely loyal Uralic tribes. Its only role is to protect Novgorod and its trade concerns from the raids of the Siberians. What was once was a barely cultivable territory plundered by slave raids and migrating hordes has recently started to become one of the richest territories in the Union. The Ural Mountains have become a major center of extraction for metals and coal, giving every man the opportunity to become rich if he's willing enough to toil in the mines or haul the goods to the Russian river network along dangerous routes. Most of the trade, especially fur, comes from Siberian tributaries or trade routes across the Perm pass, which is administered by the Fur Guild. This has of course caused many problems for Yugran traders, who are forced to pay a large tariff despite having moved within their own territory and often rely on contraband.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS26.A;And the problem is?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.T;The Guild concerns;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.D;The Fur Trade Guild has formally petitioned the Veche to legislate on the transit of goods crossing the Urals, following a loss of income as Yugran traders use contraband to circumvent their monopoly. This demand has been met with surprisingly large opposition as hostile guilds, representatives of the Yugran territories and even members of the clergy have united against the backward proposal that would create further barriers within the union and concentrate even more power in the hands of a few merchants in the city of Novgorod. The Fur Guild which funds half the liberal associations of Novgorod find themselves having to rely on their political enemies to protect their lucrative monopoly. In the Veche three proposals emerge: the first law would confirm Guild privileges, expand the number of border patrols and enforce the tariff. The second law would create a competitive market for the Guilds and the Yugran traders. Finally, the "Laptev Amendment'', proposed by a representative from Arkhangelsk asks for the creation of a national Siberian Fur Trade Company.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.A;The Guild shall keep its privileges!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.B;Let the free market decide!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS27.C;Nationalize the fur trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.T;Monopoly confirmed by the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.D;The Fur Trade Guilds proposal has reached the Council of Lords, and was passed into law. Now the Guild has received the authorization to monitor the passes of the East and keep a close eye on Siberian trade. While a great move for the urban bourgeoisie of Novgorod, the law would create resentment in the East, and would provoke years of unrest and smuggling in Yugra.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS28.A;Let the furs... flow?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.T;Monopoly rejected by the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.D;Surprisingly the Council of Lords has rejected the Veche proposal of confirming their monopoly and privileges. Many thought that the aristocracy would support the urban bourgeois since it would benefit them in the end, but past grudges between the two groups were too strong to overcome. It has become clear to the Veche, that Guild privileges have gone too far and that the riches of the Novgorodian eastern lands are being left unsold due to useless ancient privileges. The creation of a modern trading company, as proposed by the Laptevs, which may kickstart Novgorodian economy, gains support in the assembly despite the risk of angering one of the most powerful political groups in the republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.A;The status quo endures;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS29.B;Let us petition the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.T;The Prince does nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.D;Years have done their work on Simeon Yumin who seems hardly fit to rule anymore. When the Veche representatives reached him, the old man refused to receive them because it would interrupt his sleeping habits, and only after one aide convinced him to host them, he decided to welcome them in his quarters. His response was as harsh as his first words had been: the amendment would not receive any support from him as he respected the traditions of Novgorod. The status quo will leave a bitter stain in Novgorodian politics as the Yugrans often continue to fight against the Guild.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS30.A;Damn the old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.T;The Prince supports the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.D;Years have done their work on the Prince of Novgorod, but he is still involved in Novgorodian politics. Following the proposal of the Veche to create a national Siberian Fur Trade Company, the Prince would decide to pass the Laptev amendment into law. While a profitable endeavor for the Republic, this action would necessitate heavy compensation to the Fur Guild who was to be absorbed by the Company and anger the aristocracy who had been sidelined.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS31.A;Thank you, old man?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.T;A surprising action;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.D;The Prince of Novgorod has been known for his erratic behaviour over the years, many seeing him either as a fool or a Machiavellian politician. His latest action confirmed the rumours of the latter as he decided not to adopt the draft of the Veche but grant the Laptev family a charter for Siberian fur trade. Many did not understand the move and thought it to be motivated by pure madness. But a year later, the Guild and the Company would merge into the Novgorodian Fur Company, hiring Yugrian traders and hunters for their endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS32.A;A great move, but was it deliberate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.T;Free trade of furs;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.D;Surprisingly, the Council of Lords has accepted the proposal of the Veche to expand the regulation of movement from the White Sea to Novgorod, de facto creating a competitive market in Siberia. The move greatly angered the Fur Guild who was nonetheless compensated for the loss of privileges, and it did not change much in the Novgorodian economy as the Guild was the main entrepreneur and still dominated the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS33.A;A wasted opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.T;Refusal from the Lords;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.D;Surprisingly, the Council of Lords has accepted the proposal of the Veche to expand the regulation of movement from the White Sea to Novgorod, which would have created a competitive market in Siberia. The only person capable of ending this deadlock is the ailing Prince of Novgorod, but members of the Veche have expressed preference to letting the status quo endure rather than having to face his unpredictable temper. The Veche could also ask the Prince for approval of a modified and moderate version of the law which also contains parts of the original Laptev Amendment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.A;Leave the old man alone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS34.B;Go to the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.T;The Prince follows the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.D;The princes involvement has resulted in the moderate version being promulgated into law. Nothing noteworthy changes in Novgorod following this legislation and the Guild and its supporters consider themselves very offended by the recent attacks. No one is happy about this arrangement, as the Guild still retains an important power in Yugra and the rest of the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS35.A;A waste of time and money...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.T;The Prince enforces status quo;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.D;The Prince has enforced the status quo concerning the Ural passes and tariffs, angering the Yugrian traders. Moreover it has led to new expenses for border forts in the East. Nothing noteworthy changes as the independent merchants continue to struggle against the Guild which is itself angered by the attacks it suffered in the Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS36.A;Unity in Novgorod is no simple task...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.T;The decision of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.D;The Prince of Novgorod has been known for his erratic behaviour over the years, many seeing him either as a fool or a Machiavellian politician. His latest action confirmed the rumours of the latter as he decided not to adopt the draft of the Veche but grant the Laptev family a charter for Siberian fur trade. Many did not understand the move and thought it to be motivated by pure madness. But a year later, the Guild and the Company would merge into the Novgorodian Fur Company, hiring Yugrian traders and hunters for their endeavour.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS37.A;A surprise, but a good one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.T;The Lords refuse the Company;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.D;The Veche has asked for the creation of a Siberian fur trade company, only to have the Council of Lords reject the proposal. Debates are still going though, as Aristemy Laptev gathers several witnesses and various supporters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS38.A;What will happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.T;The Semyonov testimony;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.D;Aristemy Laptev has taken the opportunity brought by the ongoing debate to denounce the unlawful practices of the Fur Merchants Guild, exposing their unlawful treatment of Novgorodian citizens in the north and in Siberian lands and blaming them for the misery of these naturally rich territories. The testimony of Vasily Semyonov, a Yugrian fur trader who lost an eye following an attack by Guild agents shook the assembly to the core. In the chaos of the revelation, a group of radical representatives in the Veche has started an overall attack against Guild privileges of all kinds, asking for the abolition of many ancient rights that hamper Novgorod's ascent into modernity, or so they claim. The Veche representatives must now propose either the dissolution of all the guilds or just focus on ending the Fur Trade Guild and then pass the proposal for the Prince for approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.A;The Veche votes on the dissolution of all Guilds!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS39.B;The Veche only targets the Fur Trade Guild;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.T;Dissolution of the Guilds;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.D;Given the guilds' sudden infamy and the discovery of serious cases of corruption, the Prince easily accepted the Veches proposal and the backlash was limited. Many guilds eventually resurfaced as enterprises or associations within a solidified free market. The Novgorodian system has changed for the better according to many, and has become more western-like.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS40.A;Guilds were an hindrance to prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.T;The Status Quo endures;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.D;The prince has refused to end the Guilds, claiming they were an important part of Novgorodian society that could not be liquidated. Intellectuals resent Novgorod's unwillingness to abandon what they consider its feudal roots and eastern trade remains the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS41.A;Well, nothing changed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.T;The end of the Fur Trade Guild;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.D;The Fur Traders Guild was dissolved by the Prince following the Semyonov testimony, but it soon resurfaced under a new guise. Trans-Uralic trade ended up still heavily regulated and Novgorod-based merchants were able to keep the largest slice of the cake, leaving the Yugrian and Pomors in relative poverty. The liquidation was thus a radical move (and expensive) but it neither changed the situation for Northerners nor shook up the traditional status quo of Novgorod's trade regulations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS42.A;Well, this backfired...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.T;The Prince refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.D;The Prince has refused the proposal to end the Fur Trade Guild, preserving the status quo in spite of the recent revelations. Following this action, it appeared to most people in the north and east that Novgorod had once again taken a step backward, preserving ancient institutions to keep its aristocrats happy instead of choosing the interest of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS43.A;Is it that bad?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.T;A new proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.D;The Prince has refused the liquidation of the Guild and chose to enforce a competition regime, starting by granting a chapter to the Laptevs to create a new Fur Trade Company with a timed monopoly on Siberian and Arctic Trade. With their practises exposed in Novgorod the Guild is forced to reform and change its stances towards the Yugrians, and even start working with the Laptves. The economy of Novgorod is booming, and eventually the fur trade system becomes the basis for new enterprises in the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS44.A;A happy ending!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.T;The Princedom of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.D;Novgorod maintained control of the lower Ob river valley (also known as Kantekia) with the support of various Khanty and Mansi tribes hostile to the Sibir Khanate. While the southern tribes were under the control of the Yugrian Confederation, tasked with the protection of the Urals from Siberian raids, the northern tribes recognised the authority of a Prince, who had direct contact with a Novgorodian military governor. The Prince of Kondia (from the name of an Ob tributary) collected the yasak from the local Khanty-Mansi tribes, including some from the Siberian wilderness. By taking advantage of a period of political distress, the Prince of Kondia has become even more politically relevant. Some tribes in the south and the east have also gathered under his protection, defying their old Tatar or Cossack masters. The Princedom of Kondia is now, de facto, a vassal state of the Novgorodian Confederation and not a mere tribal institution to collect taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS45.A;A worrying development;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.T;The Princedom of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.D;We are forced to give lands to the Prince of Kondia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS46.A;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.T;The Pomors;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.D;For a long time, the inhabitants of the Russian Far North have met and mixed with Uralic people, Southerners fleeing war and serfdom, Cossacks and Tatars searching for new homelands, sects and monks looking for isolation and many adventurers willing to risk their lives in the Arctic Sea. Thanks to this varied influx of cultures and the proximity to the sea, the "Pomors'' have distinctive traditions and customs that make them unlike any other Russian community. Most of them are Povolniks, people who are not bound by constant obligations with any guild, princedom, monastery or boyar. The main center of Pomor culture is the port of Arkhangelsk. A group of Pomor intellectuals and merchants, including representatives from communities in Scandinavian territory have recently created the Saint Michael Brotherhood to further Pomor culture, economical and political interests. The organisation creates problems in Finnmark, as its local chapters alarm Scandinavian officials who are concerned about a growing Russian presence and influence in the area, but they also generate wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.A;Restrict the movement;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS47.B;Accept their benefits and leave them alone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.T;Developments in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.D;Recent events in Novgorod have started to strain the relationship between the Volosts in the North and the capital. Unlike Vyatka or Yugra, the popular assemblies of these territories are supervised by a governor sent from the capital. The locals have created a Seven Volost Assembly gathered in Veliky Ustyug, under the auspices of salt and iron magnate Maksim Rogovich-Strogonov. They have formed a new entity under the name Permyak Federation, taking inspiration from ancient Great Perm and acknowledging Komi-Russian intermingling. Rogovich-Strogonov's immense influence in Novgorodian politics forced the recognition of his autonomous fief, of which he was chosen as the first Posadnik. Meanwhile in the farthest north, the Volost of Pustozersk refused integration into the Permyak Federation. This region is dotted with isolated orthodox monasteries, acting as intermediaries between the Pomor merchants and the Nenets tribes. From the chapter of Pustozersk, Archimandrite Tikhon gained the prerogatives of the former governor in Zapolyarnia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS48.A;Two new states in the Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.T;The Pomor Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.D;The Pomors have reached a point of no return regarding their relationship with Veliky Novgorod. After centuries of obedience and service, the people of the Russian Far North have decided to organise into an autonomous political entity within the Novgorodian confederation. No longer shall governors and city boyars hinder the decisions of the free Pomor people. This has been a painful decision, but following the birth of numerous Pomor cultural associations and their meddling with the politics of Arkhangelsk it had become clear that Pomor separatism was gaining the upper hand in the region. Secession talks are still frowned upon, but this separation will leave an ugly scar regardless. The prince of Novgorod can decide to nominate a prince when he promulgates the Founding Charter of the new state or let the Pomors govern themselves with fully democratic institutions like Vyatka and Yugra.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.A;Nominate a prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS49.B;Let them rule themselves;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.T;Scandinavian attack;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.D;Our annexation of Pskov and our refusal to part with Ingria has attracted the ire of the Scandinavians. Copenhagen sees us as a possible threat to their Baltic hegemony and has declared war on us with the intent to humiliate us and retake the coastline. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS50.A;We learnt from Nevsky !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.T;Utter defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.D;Not a single shot was fired in the end. Scandinavian troops walked in Karelian villages with the approval of the locals as the instability of the Republic has grown too strong. Our leaders were weak and divided and we pay the price for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS51.A;How could that happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.T;Victory in Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.D;To the surprise of many, Novgorodians managed to fight back the Scandinavians, surprising their regiments in the cold forests of the North. The Republic was divided, but now it appears stronger than before, with the leaders of the Republic joining together for the cause. The victory of Novgorod has been deemed the new David and Goliath fight in Russia, and many patriots rejoice throughout the land for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS52.A;A glorious event !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.T;Defeat in Karelia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.D;Karelia was soon taken by the Scandinavians as our Republic could not manage to muster its forces efficiently against this stronger enemy. The divisions between our leaders have hampered our war effort and many people have grown disillusioned at the state of the Republic, especially the Pomors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS53.A;Its just snow and trees though;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.T;The War for what ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.D;Karelia didnt just matter to much people in Novgorod. After the various crises of the previous years, the question of holding on or not onto Karelia didnt matter for many. Ultimately the Kremlin did not really care much than the rest of the population about deserted Pomor territory and was not willing to make it a national affair after the rough experiences of the previous years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS54.A;Why die for Karelia indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.T;The Glorious victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.D;Karelia may be empty land without a lot of interest but the war was seen as many as the last piece towards the rebirth of the united Republic. Soldiers fought for the unity of the nation and leaders temporalily set aside their grudges for the good of Novgorod. This ensured a victory against the master of the Baltic sea and one of the great colonial empires of Europe. Now is the time for celebration and the continued reconstruction of our Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS55.A;Long live our Lord Novgorod !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.T;Revanchism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.D;The war for Karelia had mobilized every soul and body in the nation but it was not enough in the end. But as Karelia was lost, our national consciousness still endures stronger than ever. People are already enlisting and preparing for the revenge and reconquest of our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS56.A;Well get them !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.T;The massacre of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.D;Scandinavian victory was the natural result in their war against Novgorod. The armies of the Republic could not stand and defend the lands they had stolen from Scandinavia. Eventually Scandinavians breached the city walls and secured the Kremlin. As they intended to place another puppet Prince a bomb exploded and killed several men of a Norwegian regiment. In retaliation, the troops set the city ablaze, looting and killing on sight. Novgorod ended on this day, as the various states east declared independence and refused to let Scandinavians into their country. Copenhagen settled on influencing the rump states of Novgorod and the Pomors, securing their hold in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS57.A;What an horrible fate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.T;The miracle on the Neva;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.D;Many thought that Novgorod would be forced to submit to Scandinavia after having annexed the Republic of Pskov. But the forces of the fledging Republic managed to fight back the foreign troops and securing their hold on the Baltic. Now is a time of celebrations in the Republic, as Scandinavia has also been forced to pay heavy reparations and admit the independence of Lord Novgorod the Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS58.A;The world turned upside down !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.T;The defeat of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.D;The attempt by Novgorodians to challenge the status quo and take back the Republic of Pskov ended in defeat as Scandinavians managed to get back their territories and occupied large swaths of land in Novgorod proper. The Novgorodian prince was forced to go to Copenhagen to sign an humiliating treaty. Pskov was to be taken back by Scandinavia and the Republic would pay an enormous war reparation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS59.A;A shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.T;Scandinavian defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.D;The Second Neva War has ended in victory for Novgorod which managed to take back its Baltic Coast and force Scandinavia to recognize its independence. In addition, heavy war reparations were paid in exchange for the numerous Scandinavian prisoners trapped during the winter campaign and the end of occupation of the Baltic and Finnish lands of Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS60.A;A glorious future for Novgorod !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.T;Victory for Scandinavia?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.D;Scandinavia fought an hard war in Novgorod as militias from the whole Confederation flocked to the Baltic coast to defend their land. Even after countless victories on the battlefields, the spirit of Novgorod was never broken. When they entered the city Kremlin, the officials had fled to the countryside and led a guerrilla war. Eventually peace was signed with heavy reparations, but Novgorod endures as a strong country in Russia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS61.A;Peace without victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.T;Victory of Lord Novgorod the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.D;The Second Neva War had triggered a national awakening in the Republic as the people came together to fight the oppressors. Militias from the whole Confederation held on the Baltic fortresses and forced the Scandinavian armies to flee from their country. Huge crowds have gathered in the capital to celebrate the victory and public enemies like the Posadnik Levashov and the Prince of Galich Matveyev were seen together with the Prince to announce a reorganization of the Republic with a new Millenial Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS62.A;Long live Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.T;The Millenial Charter;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.D;The Millennial Charter has been signed by representatives from the whole Republic, giving Novgorod a new written constitution following the national cohesion created by the war. The confederate nature of the republic is formally preserved, but the reorganisation de facto creates a federal system with a strong central authority under the helm of the Veche. Powers of the Prince and Lords have been reduced, while serfdom is gradually abolished throughout the land, although compensation for former owners are very expensive. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS63.A;A new millennium for Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.T;Treaty of Ingria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.D;Our aim was to take back the whole Republic of Pskov, but the war took such a huge toll on our forces that many think it would be best to just limit ourselves to the Baltic coast as to not trigger another war in the foreseeable future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.A;We will be merciful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS611.B;We won didnt we?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.T;Death of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.D;After a long and disastrous reign, Simeon Yumin, the Prince of Novgorod has finally died. Despite his erratic behaviour, he was widely recognised as the last figure capable of keeping together the confederation.\n\nThe Council of Lords and the Veche have convened to elect a new Prince but are unable to find a similarly compromising figure. Meanwhile, the confederation is in such a chaotic state that representatives from the Siberian and Uralic territories have not reached Novgorod yet. Dimitriy Matveyev, the Prince of Galich, and one of the most reactionary figures in the feudal faction, has been the main obstacle to the election process, having recalled multiple times the representatives of his princedom from both the Council of Lords and the Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS64.A;These are troublesome times;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.T;The Siege of the Kremlin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.D;After weeks of deadlock, the Prince of Galich has decided with the support of the military to take power. While the plot was largely successful as the troops took control of most of the city, the liberals and progressives barricaded themselves in the city Kremlin. Among them, Konstantin Levashov, the Posadnik and leader of the progressive faction, awaits the arrival of the Northerners and Siberians while hiding in the city Kremlin. The siege begins, with the Kremlin completely cut off by the troops of the feudal faction. Eventually, the Prince of Galich offers a final deal to the besieged: exile or death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.A;Exile is best for the city...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS65.B;The Posadnik holds on;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.T;Death of the confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.D;Following the ultimatum from the Prince of Galich, the Posadnik Levashov convened with his followers gathered in the Kremlin and decided to accept exile. A white flag was hoisted from the walls, as the defenders walked out and passed before the infamous Prince of Galich who still kept true to his word and let them go without molestation. With the siege of the Kremlin ending and the exile of his opponents, the Prince is free to reorganize Novgorod as he sees fit. All pseudo-democratic institutions were reduced to mere formalities while the title of Prince was formally given to the Metropolitan. But all effective power has been transferred to a Committee of Ministers led by the Prince of Galich. Meanwhile the authority of Novgorod has crumbled in the North and East, as the Pomors and Uralics refuse to accept the new state of affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS66.A;Novgorod lives;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.T;The shelling of the Novgorod Kremlin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.D;The besieged liberals have refused the ultimatum of their opponents, prompting the shelling and destruction of the city Kremlin. The last pockets of resistance in the ruins were then cleared by the bayonet, with the corpse of the leader of the Veche, Konstantin Levashov found in the ruins. The oldest city of Russia is forever scarred and the whole Slavic world looks at those responsible for this tragedy with shame. The title of Prince, which prompted the whole affair, remains vacant as one by one domestic and foreign candidates refuse the blood-stained crown, leaving the feudal faction in disarray. The Novgorod confederation ends, as everyone thinks for themselves. The Princes return to their fiefs, preparing to deal with the incoming rebellion while the military command establishes a provisional administrative assembly and de facto takes control of the Novgorod region. Garrisons around the country are emptied as many defect or are called to the central territories to safeguard what remains of the city and its neighbourhoods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS67.A;A sad end for Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.T;Fate of the peripheries;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS68.D;The throne of Novgorod is vacant, after a millenium of greatness, the city of Rurik barely controls the surrounding countryside. Novgorod has become a military dictatorship and the confederation has been dissolved. The Siberian delegates reach the city as it resembles more of a military barracks than the old capital. Their assembly no longer exists, the periphery has been abandoned. The shockwave of the collapse makes local institutions unstable, opening the path for commanders and conspirators to take the reins of the states left unguarded. The local Novgorodian garrisons can take control instead of retreating to the capital, or local boyars and noble with the support of the military can dissolve the democratic institutions, or simply informs them of the trying future that awaits them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS69.T;Death of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.D;The Prince of Novgorod has died, leaving behind a country more divided than ever. The boyars in the Council of Lords and the representatives of the Veche are unable to compromise on a candidate. In the baroque halls of the grandiose Yaroslav's Palace, across the Volkhov from the Kremlin, a fight erupts among the delegates. Prince Dimitriy Matveyev of Galich accuses Posadnik Konstantiv Levashov of seeking absolute power for himself through populism and the bending of all institutional rules. The Posadnik replies by attacking the backwardness of the princes, whose hatred for progress in all fields is bringing the great republic down to the levels of its southern neighbours. In a final gesture of goodwill, all factions agree to convene for the first time in more than two centuries a Bishop's Veche, near the Holy Wisdom Cathedral at the centre of the Kremlin. The Metropolitan asks for a week of solitude and prayer before making his decision, hoping to find spiritual guidance through the Znameniye icon that saved the city multiple times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS69.A;Let the Holy Wisdom enlighten him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.T;Choice of the Metropolitan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.D;In the old times, the Metropolitan of Novgorod had been a leading political figure in the Republic, especially when weak princes came and went. With the decline of Unitarianism and the rationalisation of traditional political institutions, the religious head lost most of its influence, while remaining a respected national unifying figure even for Orthodox citizens. The old Metropolitan Dmitry, confirmed by Rome and Tver merely three years prior, had little experience with the city's politics, preferring the ascetic lifestyle of the city's numerous monasteries, yet he had no choice but to bear on his shoulders the confederation's future. He ponders his options: Vyacheslav Chemiakin-Belsky, a prominent and devout nobleman has the support of the aristocracy. Meanwhile, he could say he found no figure and propose a vote of the unified Veche. Or he could propose a vacancy of the office, leaving four years for the oppositions to die down. As he emerges from the Cathedral before the Veche he finally proposes.:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.A;The Metropolitan proposes Chemiakin-Belsky for the Prince office;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.B;Count the votes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS70.C;The Metropolitan proposes to elect no Prince for the moment;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.T;The Cathedral explosion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS71.D;The Metropolitan announced his support for the feudal faction's candidate, Vyacheslav Chemiakin-Belsky, an affluent landowner from a minor branch of the Yaroslavl's Belsky known for his zealous patronage of church-building projects and traditional values. This decision infuriated the anti-feudal faction and made the delegates from Siberia and the North particularly uneasy given the Prince's zealotry. Right before the enthronement ceremony, boycotted by the opponents, a powerful explosion devastates the entrance of the Holy Wisdom Cathedral, killing 24 participants including the Metropolitan. Vyacheslav survives, miraculously unscathed, and immediately blames his opponents. The Veche is dissolved via ukase while the plotters are sentenced to capital punishment in absentia. In Staraya Russa, on the other side of the Ilmen Lake, the surviving members of the Veche pledge their loyalty to "Lord Novgorod the Great", a metaphorical way to refer to the City, refusing to swear fealty to a Prince. The two sides gear up for war to restore the "Republic".;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS73.A;For the Prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.T;Victory of the Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.D;Prince Vyacheslav Novgorodsky, as he has been renamed, has won over his opponents, unifying Novgorod under his strong hand. Novgorod has become a princedom not very much different from his southern neighbours, especially Yaroslavl, and it seems that the ambitions of the Northern State will not stop at just unifying Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS74.A;Long live Vyacheslav!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.T;Restoration of the confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.D;Prince Vyacheslav has been defeated along with his allies by the free forces of the North and the East. The old republic is restored, with a sympathetic nobleman proclaimed as the new prince by the restored Veche. The Council of Lords has been curtailed however and the old princedoms of the Confederation have been annexed directly in retaliation for their actions. Novgorod is far from being truly united as the control over the East and North is not assured.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS75.A;Long live the restored Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS77.D;The war has ended without a true victor. Novgorod is now reduced to the original city and the old feudal princes, while its former subjects in the East and North have become independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS77.A;An end to the old Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.T;The Bakers Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.D;After the Metropolitan categorically refused to assume the title of Prince or a new ad hoc equivalent, voting resumed. But the conflict amidst factions grew so violent that the bishop's Veche had to be dissolved and the Kremlin vacated with military intervention. Street fighting ensued between the City's Guard and supporters of the opposed factions. After a week of attempted restoration of control, rumours of incoming military columns from Beloozero and the South started spreading. Supporters of the feudal faction had already escaped the city when an anti-boyar pogrom ravaged the city. Posadnik Konstantin Levashov organised a makeshift "Five Kontsy Council'' to replace the de facto defunct Council of Lords and Veche. The "Bakers Coup'', as it was contemptuously called in the princedoms, marked the end of the "Old Republic". The reactionary states of the Confederation joined forces with a large section of the military command to restore order in Novgorod at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.A;The Republic must put down the princes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS78.B;The Prince of Beloozero will safeguard our traditions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.T;The Novgorodian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.D;After weeks of pointless negotiation and preparation on both sides, Levashov formally declared the Princedom of Beloozero and Galich enemies of the confederation and prepared to end their continued independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS79.A;For the city!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.T;Victory of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.D;Beloozero has fallen and the republic has been preserved. Levashov nonetheless refused to disband his puppet Five Kontsy Council and has proposed the creation of a "Chamber of the Pyatinas" as a parallel assembly. The Council would legislate on Novgorod's surroundings, while the Chamber would deal with matters regarding the periphery. The Posadnik would remain a leading figure in both institutions, as they are filled with his own yes-men, but the states' autonomy would be respected, at least formally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS80.A;Our Posadnik knows the way!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.T;Posadniks choice;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.D;We accepted Levashovs power grab because of the threat the feudal lords have portrayed, but now that Beloozero and Galich are vanquished, it seems that he will not be content with the way the republic worked. He has sent a message to all the members of the confederation to join the Chamber of Pyatinas and to be integrated more closely into the republic. But at the same time, the old institutions that guaranteed our rights and a form of democracy have been side-lined, so we could refuse this new arrangement and go our own way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS81.A;We follow the Posadnik...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.B;We wont accept tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.T;The "New Confederation Charter";;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.D;With the old confederation integrated and under the power of Levashov, the Posadnik has promulgated the New Confederation Charter that acts as the new Constitution of the republic. The powers of the Posadnik are near absolute, as he rules for life and can appoint at will the members of the various assemblies. At least Novgorod knows order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS82.A;Long live the Posadnik-for-life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.T;Reorganization of Novogorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.D;The Five Kontsy Council that led the city since the riots that followed the Bishops Veche has been vanquished by the princes and members of the military. Novgorod is pacified as the would-be Dictator Levashov lies hanged like a peasant inside the Kremlin. The city suffered another scarring event with a terrible repression, but order is now reinforced. A puppet noble, Roman Medvedev, has been selected as the prince of Novgorod, and the old institutions have been reformed to concentrate all real power in the Council of Lords, the true political body of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS83.A;Long live the aristocrats!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.T;Annexation of Beloozero;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.D;Fulfilling its political goals, Beloozero is ready to rejoin Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS84.A;Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.T;End of the old Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.D;As the war dragged on, the free states blamed Levashov for having destroyed the confederation and the loss of liberties and rights they suffered. The East and North thus left, while the southern princes were also unable to defeat the Posadnik. His powerbase in Novgorod has been consolidated and he tightened his grip on the city and its surroundings. The Novgorod Republic now only exists on paper and the new Novgorodian state forged by the "New Rurik" is a completely new entity where power rests only in the hands of the Posadnik who rules for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS85.A;A sad end for Novgorod...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.T;The Metropolitan prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.D;The last vacancy of the Novgorodian throne dated back to two centuries earlier and it coincided with partial Scandinavian occupation, leading some to think that the confederation had effectively entered its final days. Postponing the election of the Prince requires a supermajority in the joint assembly of the Veche and the Council of Lords. The feudal faction demands to vote for a new prince, knowing well that a vacancy would mean greatly expanding the prerogatives of Posadnik Konstantin Levashov. As the assembly nearly ends up in riot, the Metropolitan decides to take a decisive step to avoid the dissolution of the confederation. Against his wishes, he accepts the nomination as Prince. The feudal faction reluctantly accepts the compromise, hoping to be advantaged by a conservative leader. But the Metropolitan is politically incompetent and his desire to stay neutral leads to absolute prominence of the Posadnik. Only a few weeks after the election, the Council of Lords is dissolved by decree of the Veche, prompting division in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS86.A;An unexpected development;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.T;The Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.D;The dissolution of the Council of Lords by the Veche has alarmed the southern princes, who fear that the new regime will restrict their privileges. The Posadnik Levashov has thus decided to declare war to restore order in the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS87.A;Destroy the Princes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.T;Victory of the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.D;The Republic of Novgorod has vanquished the reactionaries of the southern princedoms, securing the role of the Veche and other democratic institutions. The first act of the reunified Republic was the long-awaited abolition of serfdom. But even victorious, the Republic has already fallen again in various political disputes, and it seems there is no grand vision of its future and its role amongst the various eastern Slavic states.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS88.A;A victory nonetheless!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.T;Feudal victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.D;As the Prince of Beloozero and Galich managed to win against the new Novgorod Republic, the confederation has reverted back to its old state: Levashov has fled abroad as armies marched to the city and the Veche has been purged, while old institutions like the Council were reinstated. The Metropolitan abdicated as the prince and the winners of the war chose Roman Medvedev, a weak nobleman as the new prince. The confederation appears frozen in its old derelict state, and it will not have the strength to rescind the rights of its constituent states, should a threat appear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS89.A;A new situation in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.T;Failure of the republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.D;The white peace between the princes and the republic was seen as a shameful stain on the republic. Convinced that the urban bourgeoisie could not lead the republic to a strong future the various members of the confederation chose to leave and take their fate into their own hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS90.A;The end of a political legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.T;Death of the prince;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.D;The death of the Prince of Novgorod closed a troubled parenthesis in the history of the Novgorodian Confederation. Veliky Novgorod, the Russian gate to the west, represented the tensions between two seemingly irreconcilable societies: a city of world-travelling merchants, sublime poets and Croesus-like lords living and voting side by side with the wretched of the Russian lands, the faceless human machines in the new factories or the wandering souls of the rural estates and arctic villages. Many Panrussian intellectuals thus look at Novgorod as the most desirable candidate for the unification of the Slavs. During the joint meeting of the Council of Lords and the Veche to nominate the new prince, many wanted to seize the opportunity to settle old feuds, notably the Posadnik Levashov. But in the end, his candidate, the weak Roman Medvedev, was soundly defeated by the Livonian noble Pyotr Gustavovich Litke, the first non-boyar elected to the office. Originally from Dorpat, he had made himself known in Novgorod for his anti-Scandinavian rhetoric.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS91.A;Long live Pyotr Gustavovich!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.T;The nomination of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.D;The first obstacle to the rule of Prince Pyotr Litke was the cohabitation with his insubordinate Posadnik Levashov. Gathering allies in the Veche, Pyotr Litke helped the Prince of Galich and Levashov's main opponent Ivan Anisimov strike him down. Konstantin Levashov thus lost his title of Posadnik a few days after the election, but retained his seat in the Veche. The Prince now has the power to influence the selection of the next Posadnik, but he knows well that he must play divide et impera. Having been elected for his strong will and his distance from any major boyar clan, his role was to remove Levashov and restart the political rotation of the office between the factions. Litke has ambitions of his own and he knows that his supposed allies have little esteem of him, but at the same time he knows that to build his rule he needs solid foundations. The prince can either come to terms with Levashov and allow the election of Anisimov as Posadnik or let the ex-Posadnik and the Cossack smear each other freely in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.A;The Prince brokers a deal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS92.B;The Prince stays out of it;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.T;Anisimov elected Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.D;After a series of meetings between the candidates and the Prince, the Veche elects Ivan Anisimov as the new Posadnik. The session was surprisingly calm given how Levashov's supporters had insinuated until merely days prior that Anisimov was a co-conspirator of a "reactionary coup". Many saw this event as a sign of the Prince's effective mediation skills and Levashov's acceptance of his downfall. But two weeks after the election, Levashov's political stances had completely reversed, bringing him back in the spotlight. He claimed that Anisimovs extremist and incapable" government was bringing the country on the brink of collapse and that only the guidance of the prince could bring Novgorod back on the right track. Even if Anisimov had only ruled for a dozen days, he had already attracted resentment from nearly all Novgorodian society for he was ambitious and idealistic, but far from capable. Once again, Pyotr Litke moved behind the scenes to broker a deal between two former archenemies: Konstantin Levashov and the prince of Galich Dimitriy Matveyev.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS93.A;What does the prince choose?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.T;The curtailing of the Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.D;In a surprising turn of events, Prince Pyotr Litke openly addressed the Veche about the government of Posadnik Anisimov, deeming it "divisive" and "misguided". With the compliance of the reactionaries brought by Matveyev, Levashov's cronies and the disillusioned former supporters of Anisimov, the prince has bent centuries old rules with a simple speech. Not only had he curtailed the Posadnik as the most influential figure in the state, he had also greatly reduced the prominence of the Veche. With the Veche under control and Anisimov removed from power, the new Triumvirate of Litke, Levashov and Matveyev affirmed the control over the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS94.A;Long live the new Princedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.T;The Novgorodian Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.D;Following his speech in the Veche, the prince gathered his allies to work on a constitution. Levashov and Matveyev old distrust and enmity was soon soothed by the diplomatic attitude of the prince. The three men agreed that Novgorods institutions were to be renovated. The prince would gain accrued power establishing a Western cabinet for affairs of state and becoming an hereditary office. In exchange for these concessions, the old Veche and Council of Lords would still exert power. Levashov obtained the minister of finances while Matveyev was chosen as prime minister with the support of both chambers, unifying the confederation once and for all under the rule of the prince and his two trusted advisors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS95.A;Long live the prince!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.T;Political deadlock;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.D;Despite his actions, Litke was not able to find a common ground between Levashov and Matveyev, leading to a political deadlock. But the prince knew that he hadn't yet moved all his pieces. With the paralysis of government activities due to the political crisis many were starting to fear an action of force to restore order. The Novgorod garrison stands on alert, the prince of Galich has retreated to his estate while Levashov preaches to the mutinous capital about the sacredness of the ancient laws of Novgorod. The choice of the prince is now pivotal: will he ask the garrison to enforce order in the capital or leave the Kremlin and address the people to reassure them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.A;Gun the rioters!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS96.B;There is no problem here;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.T;The military steps in;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.D;The outrageous order of the prince shocked the garrison, which was preparing for attacks from outside the city, leading to a general mutiny. Levashov made a last attempt to save his face and distance himself from the prince, but his position was too compromised. Both the prince and the former Posadnik were brought under arrest by none other than Ivan Anisimov and his Cossack guards. The war hero and popular leader Anisimov, rivalled only by his defeated nemesis Levashov, had discarded the mask of democratic kindness, choosing his favourite recipe to restore order and peace: with military discipline and ruthless action. While the two "conspirators" were allowed to rot into the prisons of the Kremlin, Prince Matveyev was not so lucky as even before he could reach his estate and prepare to march on Novgorod, he was gunned down by one of Anisimov's best men. The whole Novgorodian Republic was now ruled the same way it controlled the northern wastes: living in fear in the shadow of the barracks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS970.A;Novgorod will know order;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.T;The Novgorodian autocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.D;The prince found the crowd already energised by Konstantin Levashov. After reassuring them that there was no incoming army, Prince Pyotr Litke started attacking the Posadnik and his government for letting the situation slip out of their hands. Seizing the moment, he announced the dissolution of the government by decree and the creation of a princely council to restore peace and the "normal functions of the Council of Lords and the Veche", which were meant to convene right after the speech. By having the consensus of the masses and the army, the Prince muted all opposition and had opponents quietly sent in prison or to the firing squad. The survivors, including Matveyev and Anisimov, bowed to the Prince a few days later in the Holy Wisdom Cathedral, where he proclaimed a new "Act for Perpetual Peace" which de facto gave him total control over all aspects of government. The Republic died, as Litke assumed autocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS97.A;The end of our traditions...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.T;Riot!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.D;After days of inconclusive debate, the Veche is unable to elect a new Posadnik, as no compromise can be found between the conservatives, Levashov's faction and Anisimov's supporters. Government activity is paralysed and fights erupt in the streets between the various factions. With a dike left unwatched because of the unrest, a major flood devastates the eastern part of the capital, including Yaroslavl's Palace and the offices of the Posadnik. The lower class neighbourhoods take this as a sign and rise in open rebellion. The allegiance of the military is not clear and there are rumours of a general mutiny or a coup. The Prince is forced to lock down in the Kremlin, cut off from the outside world due to the incessant guerilla warfare around the walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS98.A;This is madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.T;Unrest continues;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.D;The Prince still hides in the Kremlin, as the riot continues to engulf the city. The Citizen Guard formed by Levashov and the Cossacks of Anisimov rallied all men of good conditions, and restored order to the city. Now the prince must either turn towards Levashov, or heed the advice of Matyevev who has sent him a letter about restoring order at all costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.A;Accept Levashovs call;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS99.B;Order at all costs;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.T;Rule of the Posadnik;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.D;Thanks to the last minute collaboration between Levashov and Anisimov, the rebels were pushed towards the devastated riverside where they had no choice but to surrender or fight to the death among the rubble. Sadly Anisimov was shot during the street fighting, leaving only the former Posadnik at the top to once again prove to be a godsend for his people. For a few months, Levashov continued to govern with emergency decrees while the two chambers remained inactive and the Prince and the Metropolitan were safely secluded to avoid undue interference with the business of government. When the situation came back to normal, nothing had formally changed in the structure of government, but it had become obvious that the confederation was now ruled by one man only with his clique of cronies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS100.A;Levashov played everyone;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.T;Matveyevs intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.D;The general uprising comes to a sudden end as news of an incoming military column starts to spread. The provisional Council of the Five Kontsy, assembled by Posadnik Anisimov with the last minute support of Levashov (tragically deceased after an ambush), had almost completed the pacification of the city with the help of the garrison's loyalist faction, when from Ilmen Lake came the troops of the prince of Galich. From the ruins of Yaroslavl's Court, across the Volkhov from the Kremlin, he ordered Anisimov to surrender the city claiming to have been summoned by the prince to restore order. The exhausted citizen's guard had retreated north, preparing for urban warfare, with no intention to surrender. The garrison remains neutral, awaiting orders from the prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.A;Litke supports Matveyev;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS101.B;Litke contacts Anisimov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.T;The tale of two princes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.D;The prince of Novgorod emerged from the Kremlin, confirming his support for Matveyev's actions and ordered the immediate disarmament of the "rebel militias". Meeting on the New Bridge, which had miraculously withstood the flood, the two princes organised the next political and military moves to ensure the pacification of the city and the restoration of order throughout the confederation. Their demise, however, unfolded before their eyes as Matveyev's regiment fell into Anisimov's trap. The two princes then tried to retreat to the Kremlin, only to find that the garrison had defected to the Posadnik, after Matveyev armys terror tactics. The Battle on the New Bridge between Anisimov's Cossacks, the citizen's guard, and the garrison and the remnants of Matveyev's expedition force ended with a bloodbath and the summary execution of the two Princes. Hailed as a hero and the savior of the Republic, Anisimov declared the princedoms dissolved and in the following months proceeded to call the elections for a new Constituent Assembly to write a constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS102.A;Long live the hero of the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.T;One Prince leaves, the other hides;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.D;After coordinating in secret with Posadnik Anisimov, the prince emerged once again to address the city, asking for relentless resistance against the coup of the Prince of Galich. Matveyev, caught by surprise, attempted to retreat away from the city, going as far as abandoning his troops to escape dressed as a monk, but the horrible conditions of the terrain and the swift action of the garrison stopped them on their tracks. Prince Dimitriy Matveyev was brought back to Veliky Novgorod, where he was publicly executed on the grounds of the Kremlin. Prince Pyotr Litke declared the dissolution of the princedoms and proclaimed the forging of a "New Union" on the ashes of the old one. With Anisimov's trusted men enforcing the Prince's will across the confederation, the city starts recovering from the recent devastation while a new Yaroslavl Court is being built to host the reformed Veche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS103.A;Long live Litke and Anisimov!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.T;The death of two princes;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.D;The city was profoundly moved by the death of the Prince of Novgorod, a controversial yet beloved figure whose personality sternly guided the confederation through the dangerous waters of political unrest. With ever more frequent and patient collaboration, the moderates of both sides in the Veche and the Council of Lords have found a common ground for the interests of Novgorod.It has become clear to all, from the richest boyar to the most austere pomor, that the difficult and often tragic events of the last few decades have radically changed the structure of Novgorodian society who needs a new strong constitution. During the first phases of the election process for the new prince, the Russo-Livonian magnate Peter Casimir von Lütke was shot dead after accepting the candidature proposed by the conservative caucus of the two chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS104.A;Can Novgorod catch a break?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS105.T;The fall of Levashov;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS105.D;The assassin of the soon-to-be-prince had disappeared in the shroud of the night, but he was suspected to be a petty criminal hired from the slums. The crisis paralysed the works of the assembly, as the moderates accused Posadnik Levashov of having stirred unrest in lower class neighbourhoods to start a revolt and seize power. Despite his vehement counter-accusation, this was the final nail in the coffin of Levashov's declining political career, leading to his hasty discharge. His emergency replacement was Prince Dimitriy Matveyev, assuming executive power not as Posadnik but as leader of the Council of Lords. Under common accord with the vast majority of the Veche and the Council of Lords, with the exception of few reactionary elements and die-hard supporters of Levashov, it was decided to reconvene the joint assembly in two months to write a new constitution, while a Transitional Council assumed temporary control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS105.A;Unusual but necessary;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.T;The National Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.D;After weeks of political deliberation throughout the city, the new Constituent Assembly presided by the prince of Galich was convened with members from the Veche and the Council of Lords. Within a few weeks of complicated negotiations, reformulation of ancient practices and innovative codification, the new constitution was ready and can only be described as...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.A;Populist!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS106.B;Monarchic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.T;The new Popular Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.D;Despite the strong opposition of the most conservatives, it had become clear that the traditional prerogatives of the prince were an undue interference in the management of the affairs of the representatives of the Novgorodian people (with different ways based on class and census, of course). The head of state would become a symbol of national unity, as well as a moral and spiritual guide, overseeing the respect of the constitution from above the political games. Following the categorical refusal of Matveyev, it was decided as a compromise that the Metropolitan of Novgorod would always have this role, despite the timid opposition of the current office holder who was nearly forced to accept his new role. Despite this peculiar position, Novgorod grows closer to become a democracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS107.A;For the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.T;The new Kingdom of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS108.D;The centuries old traditions have been preserved by the Assembly without sacrificing the progress made in the last decades. The new constitution has however disgruntled many progressives, who see the compromise as a grungy attempt to preserve the old power relations without bringing any real improvement to Novgorod's politics, and leaving the people without a real voice. The election of the prince has been preserved, but the powers of the office have been greatly diminished, having become redundant after the rationalisation of the relationship between the two chambers by the Constitution. Roman Medvedev has been chosen as Prince thanks to his bipartisan popularity and as a sign of compromise with the former supporters of Levashov, which had been his main political sponsor. He then unveiled the new Constitution of the Kingdom of Novgorod.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NRUS112.T;Preparing the Millenium of Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NRUS112.D;As our state prepares to celebrate the Millenium of Novgorod the Great, many projects have been gathered by city officials. The less ambitious is the construction of new boulevards in the Eastern parts of the city which would intersect in front of a Bronze statue of Riourik. A renowned Anglois architect, Philippe Billaud has also proposed to destroy the old fortifications and build a new modern and planned European city. But the most ambitious and also costly project is the work of the so called 'Novgorodian school' of architecture that wants to reinvent the whole city. The Council of State must now decide between these three.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

moving_the_capital_special_liberal_desc;With Japan unified, some have proposed relocating the capital city.

decree_to_abolish_samurai_title;Decree to Abolish the Samurai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
decree_to_abolish_samurai_desc;As Japan enters the modern age, the samurai stand out as anachronistic. A feudal warrior class is not what the Japan of the future needs, and the time has come to eliminate them. This will be done peacefully through levying taxes onto their government stipends and converting said stipends into government bonds, along with replacing samurai as battlefield commanders with a professional and fully meritocratic officer corps. Though former samurai families may adopt the title of shizoku, or "warrior family," to preserve some of their honor and prestige, the samurai as a martial class will soon be but a memory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
destroy_the_samurai_title;Destroy the Samurai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
destroy_the_samurai_desc;The samurai have become a clear and present danger to national security. Not only are they a backwards remnant of the old Japan, but their status as hereditary warriors loyal not directly to the state but to the daimyo, or even, in the case of ronin, to nobody, places the government and its citizens under constant threat of intimidation or revolt. They have even displayed a disturbing tendency to support political ideologies, particularly reactionary and traditionalist schools of thought which are anathema to our own ideas. They must be eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
open_borders_JAP_title;Open Japanese Borders ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
open_borders_JAP_desc;Though our nation has grown accustomed to foreign presences, we are still not truly open to the wider world, not in the sense that the nations of Europe, Arcadia, or Ameriga are open. Our government is rapidly reaching the conclusion that we must expand our accessto the world, but a question lies before us about how far to go. Should we preserve at least some restrictions in the name of economic and cultural protection, or are all forms of isolation to be discarded?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
weaken_guild_privileges_title;Weaken Guild Privileges;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
weaken_guild_privileges_desc;The guilds' monopoly on nearly all aspects of trade and production are enfeebling our economy and chaining us down with obsolete methods and ideas. While we are not yet in a position to abolish them entirely, we can establish a set of restrictions on their operations, while also expanding the rights of merchants and generally promoting free trade as an economic practice. Taken together, these measures will undermine the guilds' dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
abolish_imperial_guilds_title;Abolish the Kabunakama;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
abolish_imperial_guilds_desc;The kabunakama, or imperial guilds, are a parasite upon the Japanese economy, shackling us to medieval conceptions of production and distribution. A modern Japan cannot have such a backwards financial system. We will issue an order immediately dissolving all guilds and seizing their assets, before splitting these assets up and selling them off to independent merchants piece by piece to prevent any one merchant from gaining too much. This will breathe new life into our economy and end guild monopolies at a stroke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JAP_kill_the_cult_title;Eliminate the Imperial Cult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JAP_kill_the_cult_desc;The establishment of an extreme Shintoist movement emphasising absolute religious purity, fanatical hostility to all other faiths, and most of all the Emperor being a living kami and ruling through absolute and divine right, has been a disaster for Japan. This cult, spread by the infernal Ministry of Divinity, has perverted our ancient traditions and caused no end of suffering, not to mention emboldening cultists to fight on even after their "divine" sovereign was deposed. We must undertake a dedicated police and propaganda effort to both wipe out the cult's remaining practitioners and de-legitimize the cult's ideology and theology among the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JAP_full_secularization_title;Embrace Full Secularization;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
JAP_full_secularization_desc;The pursuit of egalitarianism and the emancipation from outdated ideas has spread the notion of freedom of religion throughout our nation. While unthinkable mere decades ago, today Japan is accepting its status as a land of multiple faiths. Shintoism, Buddhism, Catholic and Protestant Christianity, even the shamanism of peoples like the Ainu, and many subdivisions within these religions, all exist within our nation. In light of this, it is absurd for our government to lift any one faith above the others as a matter of policy. Formal state support for any religious faith, institution, or organization shall be terminated and henceforth banned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
iwakura_mission_title;Iwakura Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iwakura_mission_desc;The Iwakura Mission or Iwakura Embassy was a Japanese diplomatic journey around the world, initiated in $YEAR$ by the oligarchs of the Sunrise Period. Although it was not the only such "mission", being heavily inspired by the earlier Fukuzawa Mission, it is the most well-known and possibly most important for the modernization of Japan after a long period of strained relations with the West. It was first proposed by the influential Dutch-Burgundian missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck years after the conclusion of the Fukuzawa Mission ordered by Prince Regent Mitsuhito. The purposes of the mission were twofold: To cultivate Japanese diplomatic ties with the Great Powers and the West in general, and to gather information on education, technology, culture, and military, social and economic structures from the countries visited in order to effect the modernization of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imperial_rescript_title;The National Rescript on Education;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imperial_rescript_desc;During the Sunrise Period, the leadership of the Japanese government felt the need to emphasize the common goals of rapid modernization (westernization) with support and legitimization of the political system centred on the imperial institution. In the 1870s and 1880s, Motoda Nagazane and other conservatives pushed for a revival of the principles of Confucianism as a guide for education and public morality. However, Inoue Kowashi and other proponents of the 'modernization' of Japan felt that this would encourage a return to the old feudal order, and pushed for a "state-centred" philosophy. Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo authorized the drafting of the Rescript, which was a compromise written largely by Inoue Kowashi with input from Motoda Nagazane and others. After it was issued, the Rescript was distributed to all schools in the country, together with a portrait of Japan's head of state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

technical_fine_arts_school_desc;Establishing the Technical Fine Arts School (Kobu Bijutsu Gakko) would help further boost the progress of our nation, numerous foreign architects, painters, and sculptors, will be employed to instruct Japanese students in Western art techniques and media. These individuals would be crucial in the development of Japanese art and architecture through the next several decades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imperial_japanese_navy_title;Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imperial_japanese_navy_desc;Japanese statesman Iwakura Tomomi submitted a document to the Dajokan titled "Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion asserting that a strong navy was essential to maintaining the security of Japan. In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions was no longer Japan's primary military concern and that that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns; a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state. Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status. Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy. After lengthy discussions, Iwakura eventually convinced the ruling coalition to support Japan's first multi-year naval expansion plan in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NJAP1.T;A New Shogun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP1.D;Last year, Tenno (Emperor) Komei was crippled in a failed assassination attempt, and is now confined to his bed and rarely conscious. Unfortunately, the Tenno is only in his fifties and he is likely to live for decades more. Abdication has almost never occured in Japan, and even if that was an option, his heir is a one-year-old baby. Thus Prince Mitsuhito, Komeis brother, has assumed the position of Sessho-no-miya, or Prince Regent. Mitsuhito was already the Daiko-Daijin, or Great Chancellor, of the Daijo-Kan, or Great Council, of the Imperial Court. The Great Council was reformed following the Imperial merger with the bakufu, but Mitsuhito seems intent on using it to claim even more power. Mitsuhito has gained rapid support among Japanese traditionalists-who seek to defend the kokutai, a complex phrase describing Japans national and cultural sovereignty-and has even begun to be referred to by his reformist and moderate opponents as a Neo-Shogun...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP1.A;We shall keep a close eye on him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP2.T;Return of Admiral Yusumoto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP2.D;A retainer of the Date clan, Admiral Yusumoto Hideki is deeply connected to Japans colonial endeavors in northwestern Arcadia. A strong proponent of the Hokkaiganese fur trade and a specialist in amphibious warfare, Yusumoto was the only surviving admiral of the Xiazhou Expedition, the ill-fated attempt to conquer Qingqiu. Owing to his familiarity with the region, Yusumoto volunteered to lead a team of Japanese marines to disable Qingqiuan naval defenses, but despite his heroic efforts, the marines under his command were encircled and destroyed. For this he faced exile and began travelling throughout the New World and Europe. He has written much during these travels, and these writings have finally been published after his return to Japan as the Travel Commentaries of Yusumoto Hideki. While a fascinating picture of the ways of other nations, the book also contains Yusumotos ruminations on the failure of Xiazhou, his arguments and suggestions for reforming the military, and some rather liberal statements on egalitarianism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP2.A;"The national military must never be hostile to reason.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP3.T;The Military Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP3.D;Yusumoto's return to Japan and the publication of his Travel Commentaries has ignited a firestorm of controversy, all centered around the military. The reformists argue that it was Western aid which tipped the scales in Qingqius favor, and thus Japan should adopt Western tactics and weapons. Most daimyos sympathize with Yusumoto and support some military reforms to avoid another Xiazhou catastrophe. Traditionalists support the proposal of the tozama or outside daimyo, a group of nobles who were the last to submit to Nobunaga, who have proposed to allow samurai status to be earned through victory on the battlefield, while stripping mediocre samurai of their statuses, effectively making the samurai a meritocracy. Prince Regent Mitsuhito has blamed Xiazhous failure on a lack of morale and purpose for the bushi (synonym of samurai) and agrees that meritocracy could revitalize them. Debate about the Military Question has begun to rage across the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP3.A;All this because of an admiral and his book?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.T;Imperial Declaration on Military Development;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.D;The Military Question has become impossible for the Daijo-Kan to ignore, and the time has come to decide the future of the Japanese armed forces. There are three general options. First, the Daijo-Kan could support the tozama daimyos proposal to impose meritocracy upon the samurai, an idea which the Sessho-no-miya prefers since it would ensure the preservation of the samurai in some form. Second, they could draft a reform to slowly eliminate the samurai class, replacing them with a professional officer corps, but without any sudden shocks to Japanese military organization. Finally, they could embrace the radicals proposal to hire advisors from Europe to teach the military the lessons learned from the Great German Wars, as well as familiarize them with modern European weapons. What shall become of the Japanese military?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.A;The best commanders of Europe shall teach us their ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.B;Professional officers shall slowly replace the samurai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP4.C;The samurai shall become meritocratic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP5.T;The Osaka Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP5.D;Japans malaise has led to increasing violence by reformists. In reaction, a traditionalist group whose name and motto is Sonno Joi, or, Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians, has formed, supporting Neo-Confucianism and a Sakoku or closed country policy. Even some traditionalists view them as a nuisance since Western trade and technology are critical for us, but some of the bushi admire Sonno Joi. These samurai have now caused trouble in Osaka, the most important city of Japan--its primary trade port, one of only three free trade ports along with Yokohama and Nagasaki, and with less powers for the Gaikoku Bugyo, foreign policy magistrates. This all has led to it possessing a large foreigner community. Yesterday, a small number of Sonno Joi samurai attacked the Anglois Merchants Association, killing a trader named Samuel Gallois. A crackdown was immediately launched against the Sonno Joi on the order of Mitsuhito to forestall Western retaliation, but the trade question has seized the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP5.A;A poor way to revere the emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.T;Trial of the Osaka Four;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.D;While the Sonno Joi movement has been curtailed across the nation, there is still the matter of Gallois murderers. Four samurai known to either belong to the Sonno Joi movement or support it--Sakuma Taketo, Fukuhara Hashimoto, Sanai Echigo, and Akane Shozan --appear to have been the orchestrators of the Osaka Incident. The Imperial judges in Osaka have found all four guilty of murder, and the Dual Monarchy was content with the verdict and reparations offered by the Imperial Court. The main question is whether the samurai will be allowed to commit seppuku to keep their honor, or whether we wish to have them executed as commoners to show the severity of the judgement and perhaps send a message about the future of the samurai class if such events occur again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.A;Allow them an honorable death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP6.B;They are rebels and traitors, to the gallows with them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.T;Imperial Declaration on Kaikoku Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.D;The Osaka Incident has inspired the various proponents of Kaikoku or open country policy to come together to try to change the official policy concerning the opening of the country to foreign trade, putting pressure on the Daijo-Kan to act. Currently, only Osaka is freely open to foreign trade, while controlled by Imperial functionaries. This excludes the leased ports of Yokohama and Nagasaki, which have become foreign enclaves. For many daimyo, further opening to trade would allow them to modernize their domains, and thus there is a strong movement to open the country even more. Moderates advise a middle ground, gradually expanding foreign access to Japan and loosening trade restrictions but preserving aspects of state control and supervision. However, the growth of the Sonno Joi movement has left a mark on our nation, and even after its curtailment there are those who believe its adherents had good ideas about preserving national integrity. What shall become of Japanese trade laws?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.A;Kaikoku must be expanded to bring prosperity to our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.B;The current system must cautiously evolve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP7.C;Sonno Joi had a point, Kaikoku must have limits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP8.T;Christianity in Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP8.D; Kirishitan are still present in Japan, but they are not what they used to be. Most Catholics are located in the Arima domain in northern Kyushu where they form an important minority along with the daimyo, thanks notably to the Jesuits of Spanish-leased Nagasaki. Meanwhile some Protestant missionaries have entered Japan through Burgundian-leased Yokohama and have converted many intellectuals over the years and have even begun to sway members of the Musashi clan itself. The status of the Christian faith, in any iteration, is ambiguous at best in Japan. Formally, it is not allowed outside of foreign legations in Osaka, and banned throughout the Imperial demesne, for example. Yet the longevity of the Christian presence and the consequences of Kaikoku mean that it has still made inroads across the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP8.A;Hello, my name is Father Chiarra, and I am here to tell you about a most amazing book!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP9.T;The Sadao Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP9.D;Shinto is an ancient Japanese polytheistic faith revolving around the kami, divine spirits which inhabit all things, and kannagara, the way of the kami, upholding the nature order. The growth of Japanese religious nationalism has given rise to State Shinto, an informal system of government-supported Shintoism. This favoritism has caused an issue in Hiroshima, due to a printer named Sadao Aoko. Owning one of the citys largest presses, he made a fortune printing Western books at cheap prices. Towards the end of his life, he sought spiritual advice from Buddhists, Catholics, and Shintoists. Sadao recently died, and he willed his shop to three different temples-Buddhist, Catholic, and Shinto! Samurai belonging to each religion entered the city to defend their faiths claim to the shop. After a riot in front of the shop, all bushi involved were arrested. Imperial judges awarded the shop to the Shintoists, but religious tensions are inflamed, while the Spanish government lodged a complaint since one bushi was apparently a Jesuit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP9.A;Our religious situation is growing perilous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.T;Imperial Declaration on Religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.D;The Sadao Affair represents a dangerous recurrence not seen in many years, a clash of samurai not over Japans government but over matters of faith, and one which has begun to open up old wounds across the country. If we want to avoid being ripped apart by religious turmoil like so many Western nations, then we must determine a national religious policy. Three options are before the Daijo-Kan. Reformists seek to establish true freedom of religion throughout Japan, creating protections against religious discrimination to prevent sectarianism. Moderates want to formally establish support for State Shinto but also want to establish limited religious pluralism to avoid unnecessary conflict. Finally, the traditionalists, in their quest to uphold the kokutai, demand extensive support for State Shinto and the explicit confirmation, by law, of the emperors status as a living kami, deifying him. What shall become of Japanese religion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.A;The only path to religious peace is religious freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
NJAP10.B;We shall support State Shinto but other faiths will be tolerated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP10.C;Shinto is supreme and the emperor's divinity is undeniable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP11.T;Education in Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP11.D;For centuries, Japan has been a center of learning and education. Confucianism, introduced ages ago, stresses the importance of an educated elite, while samurai have grown to be expected to be as skilled in literature and poetry as they are on the battlefield. Over time, however, it has become obvious that Japanese educational systems, though sufficient for literacy and everyday skills, have not advanced much in contrast to the leaps and bounds of Western methods. Though reformers frequently point to the school systems of Europe and Arcadia as models for Japan, traditionalists maintain that it is merely the techniques and resources which are lacking. This issue has begun to weigh upon the Sessho-no-miya and the Daijo-Kan as the Imperial Prince, heir to the Emperor, approaches the age where he must begin his education. A decision will need to be made, not just for the sake of the throne, but for Japans intellectual future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP11.A;Time to go back to school.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP12.T;The Fukuzawa Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP12.D;At the request of the Prince Regent, a group of scholars led by famed author and orator Baigan Fukuzawa have toured Europe and Arcadia, their primary goal being to investigate different Western methods of education in order to determine which elements Japan might adopt. The schools and universities of Anvers, Nouvelle Bruges, Paris, Prague, Stockholm, and Bologna were all visited and inspected by the Fukuzawa Mission. They have finally returned and presented their findings to the regent. Fukuzawa has endorsed the adoption of Western teaching methods, the pursuit of national literacy, and the support of universities. While this mission was limited in scope and we might benefit from a more substantial and broadened endeavor in the future, this information has fueled arguments regarding the merits of Western education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP12.A;Mitsuhito seemed unimpressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.T;Education of the Imperial Prince;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.D;The question of a national education policy and the question of the heir's education have become linked. Whichever method we choose to use for him shall shape him as a ruler and signal to the people our preferred course for Japanese education. Within the Daijo-Kan, reformists have proposed to scour Europe for the finest scholars and invite them to Kyoto to ensure that the Prince receives the most modern education possible. Moderates have suggested that scholars from the Yosho Shirabesho, a new school and research center in Edo founded by a group of famous academics to use Western literature and methods in a Japanese context, should be brought to educate the heir. Finally, Prince Regent Mitsuhito has declared that, as he is kin of the emperor and thus blessed by the kami, he should educate the heir, and it is likely that he would rely heavily on the traditionalists to aid him. What shall become of Japanese education?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.A;We need a new vision - bring foreign preceptors to Kyoto!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.B;The Yosho Shirabesho shall teach next Emperor in a balanced way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP13.C;The blessed Prince Regent Mitsuhito shall instruct the heir personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP14.T;The Decline of the Guilds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP14.D;Several institutions have come to dominate the Japanese economic landscape. The most prominent are the kabunakama, government-licensed guilds given sanctioned monopolies on certain trades such as woodcutting or brewing and operated via a group of shareholders each holding non-transmissible shares. Other groups include toimaru, wholesale merchants focused on storage and shipping, and even the venerable za, the pre-Sengoku guilds. In the aftermath of the Sengoku, Nobunaga tried to reign in the guilds by creating free guilds known as rakuza, but many of these were eventually assimilated by the older guilds into a new type of guild, the nakama. The government then attempted to start licensing these nakama, transforming them into kabunakama, but they have now become a problem. Over the last century or so, these kabunakama have come to dominate the market, and increasing industrialization and foreign competition is hurting their profits. This has now sparked a recession and even the Imperial treasury is hurting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP14.A;We must untangle our economy from these guilds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP15.T;'Raikichi-Raikuza';;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP15.D;Japan is abuzz with the new treatise, Raikichi-Raikuza or Free markets and Open guilds, written by Mizuno Heihachiro, Osakas eccentric daimyo. In it, Mizuno declares that Nobunaga sought to rebalance the Japanese economy through Raikichi-rakuza, placing urban economies into the hands of local merchants rather than guilds. This originated from the daimyo Rokakku Sayadori of Omi Province in the town of Ishidera during the Sengoku. Rokakku dissolved the za of Ishidera, granting exclusive sales and non-taxation rights to local merchants and tradesmen. This transformed the town into a trade hub, and the practice spread across Japan. However, it also fed a growing black market in order to meet rising demand. The conquest of Korea distracted the Japanese government, allowing many guilds to creep back into prominence. Mizuno concludes by arguing that these daimyo were the forerunners of liberalism. The book has become popular as people seek new financial solutions during the recession, much to the guilds ire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP15.A;Freedom of commerce is our heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP16.T;First Bank of Osaka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP16.D;Traditionally, each daimyo has had the right to issue their own currency, known as hansatu, while merchants have issued loans and guilds have managed trade, resulting in a disjointed financial system. A group of Osaka merchants, however, aims to change this. They have founded a new institution, the First Bank of Osaka. The goal of this bank is to store clients money, supply loans, print money, and make investments. The banks new shareholders have made it a priority to lobby the government to support new financial developments, pointing to the proliferation of Western corporations throughout Japan and arguing that Japan must develop its own indigenous corporations. All this has been done with the sanction of Mizuno Heihachiro, who has shielded the Bank from guild retaliation. The Banks openness and reliability has brought stability to Osaka, causing Mitsuhito to tolerate this experiment, but the kabunakama are enraged. At the same time, the Banks success has led people to question if guilds are still relevant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP16.A;The end of the kabunakama?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.T;Imperial Declaration on Guilds and Corporations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.D;The founding of the First Bank of Osaka has angered both guilds and reactionary daimyo across Japan. They are horrified at its infringement upon their traditional rights regarding money printing and commerce, as well as the unprecedented power which these merchants are claiming for themselves, with a daimyos blessing no less! The issue has reached the Imperial Court, and the Great Council must decide the fate of the Japanese economy. Reformists proclaim Mizuno to be the prophet of a free-market rebirth that Japan should embrace. Moderates propose the creation of state-supported corporations to replace the guilds, but without sacrificing state influence over the economy. Finally, traditionalists argue that the guilds are a cornerstone of Japan, and that they should be helped to modernize and reform themselves to keep the economy running smoothly, not be discarded. What shall become of the Japanese economy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.A;Mizuno is right, market liberalism was born in Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.B;We must find and form new corporations to challenge the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP17.C;The guilds must evolve, but remain relevant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP18.T;Twilight of the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP18.D;Sessho-no-miya Mitsuhito had just emerged from his morning prayer session when the emperors chief physician asked for a private word with him. After making their way to the Regents chambers, the physician brought forth shocking news : Tenno Komei is dying. While he had never recovered from his maiming in 1835, essentially becoming vegetative, it now appears that he is reaching the end of his life. His breathing is becoming increasingly strained, his pulse growing fainter with each day, and his general condition is rapidly deteriorating. Preparations must soon be made  first for the Emperors passing, and then, after a period of mourning, for the heirs coronation. Above all, however, this information must be withheld from the public so as not to cause even more chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP18.A;No matter what, this must not leak out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP19.T;Jiyu Minken Undo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP19.D;News of Komeis impending death has already leaked, and now a specter is haunting Japan  the specter of political parties. For the first time, a group of like-minded reformists have come together under the banner of a Western-style organization, the Jiyu Minken Undo, or Freedom and Peoples Rights Movement. Led by intellectuals but seeking to organize liberal and democratic-minded people across all social classes, the Jiyuto, as it is commonly known, hopes to use the Emperors passing to pressure the government for massive social reforms. Their primary demands are for a formal Japanese constitution that will enshrine the rights of the people, and many Jiyuto members also wish to push for a democratic voting system, including an elected national legislature. A few especially wild-eyed fanatics support such insane ideas as greater equality for the sexes! While purging them would be the simple option, they have brought many intellectuals into their ranks, including most scholars and educators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP19.A;What bizarre ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP20.T;The Kimimasa Draft;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP20.D;Kimimasa Yokoi is an infamous Japanese liberal author who fled into exile after being sought by the Imperial authorities for his pro-democracy tracts. He has shown particular interest in Burgundian and New World constitutionalism. After spending time in Atlantia, the Belgian Confederacy, Burgundy, and Vinland, Kimimasa has traveled to Hong Kong where he has joined the Jiyuto and written his most ambitious project yet : a draft for a Japanese constitution. It includes common suffrage, abolition of the class system, a Western style parliament, and the sanctioning of political parties. Kimimasa has also mentioned the frustrations which liberals have experienced in service to hereditary incompetents and military dictators, an obvious slur against the Prince Regent using the common insult of Neo-Shogun. The Gaikoku Bugyo heavily censored the work, but even they could not completely prevent its circulation, and now more and more of Japan seems to be infected with liberalism. The Jiyuto hail him as their prophet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP20.A;"All people must speak and be heard.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP21.T;The Obama Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP21.D;Japan is no stranger to peasant insurrections, as rural communities periodically find themselves driven to violence in order to protest tyrannical officials or to resist taxation. An incident has occurred in the town of Obama, located on the northern coast and ruled by the Sakai clan, who have been eager participants in maritime trade. The Sakai have raised higher and higher taxes on the towns fishermen in order to attract trade via low import fees. When it was announced that taxes would be increased for the third time in three weeks, the fishermen finally snapped. Wielding fishing spears and sailors knives, they stormed and torched the tax collectors office before ransacking the merchant district, touching off a general riot and extensive looting before Sarai samurai finally restored order. Disturbingly, this occurred within the Imperial domain, and the bushi report that the fishermen not only shouted Jiyuto slogans, but even called for the overthrow of the monarchy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP21.A;Anarchy, treason, madness - thanks, Obama...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.T;Drama in the Daijo-Kan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.D;Tensions between Sessho-no-miya Mitsuhito and the rest of the Great Council have finally erupted over the question of national security. Mitsuhito is convinced that the Obama Uprising proves that a vast conspiracy exists between liberals and newly insurgent republicans to overthrow and dissolve the Empire and replace it with a Western democratic clique. He therefore demands nothing less than an immediate and nationwide purge of the Jiyuto. Although much of the council has grown to distrust the movement, and agree that the republicans must be arrested, they and many other daimyo worry that giving Mitsuhito such a sweeping mandate could be used by the Prince Regent as a pretext to claim absolute power and crush all checks to his rule. Reformists argue that the government should focus on addressing legitimate grievances rather than seeking someone to blame, while the moderates support limited arrests with public gestures to reaffirm Imperial authority. Traditionalists, however, are ready to strike and await Mitsuhitos command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.A;The issues raised by the liberals ring true, and we must address them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.B;A few arrests of troublesome bushi will restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP22.C;Let the streets run red with the blood of traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP230.T;Cherry Blossoms in the Evening;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP230.D;Shortly after sunset yesterday night, Tenno Komei finally passed away. He had never truly recovered since 1835, but perhaps this was a blessing, as he never saw the chaos which Japan has spiralled through since then, nor did he pass with any pain. As per procedure, upon the chief royal physician pronouncing the Emperors death, the Imperial Prince was immediately presented with the Imperial Regalia, a replica of the legendary Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi or Grasscutter Sword and the royal Magatama necklace, confirming his status as the next to succeed. Imperial messengers and priests were sent to the Ise Grand Shrine, said to be the home of Amaterasu, as well as to the tomb-shrines of the four emperors whose reigns immediately preceded his, to inform them of the new Tenno's accession. Soon, all of Japan shall be in mourning, but Prince Regent Mitsuhito and the rest of the Daijo-Kan must prepare for the coronation, when the royal heir shall finally assume the Chrysanthemum Throne as the next Emperor of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP230.A;And so the sakura petals fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP23.T;The Start of the Meiji Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP23.D;Know ye, Our subjects, that We shall be known for Our enlightened government. It is the joy and glory of Our heart to behold the prosperity of Our country, and it is in the furtherance of the welfare of Our subjects that this prosperity shall be advanced. All classes, high and low, shall be united in the fulfillment of their promises to Our Imperial Ancestors, just as We shall fulfill Our promise to the people to bestow upon them their Natural rights. And it is through assemblies of sagacious deliberation that the rights of the people shall be expressed. The day that liberals dreamed of and traditionalists feared has finally arrived, as the Meiji Emperor heralds the advent of Japanese democracy. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike are beginning to understand their roles in a post-feudal Japan. The newly promulgated Meiji Constitution has instituted significant protections for the rights of the people, while the creation of an Imperial Parliament drawing from all classes has laid the foundations for a true democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP23.A;A new day dawns, in equally new colors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.T;Fleeting Memories;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.D;Twenty minutes before the coronation, the Imperial Prince was filled with excitement and with fear, with grief and with hope. His father had passed with a breath in the night, and now here he was, on the cusp of being made sovereign of Japan. So much planning, preparation, his entire education-no, his whole life, all leading up to this moment. Yet, he still was unsure of what sort of ruler he would be. Should he set bold goals and ally with the reformists to bring real parliamentary monarchism to Japan, or strive for a compromise between the Imperial Court and the daimyo to preserve Japans national character as it modernizes? Was this nation ready for truly liberal democracy? As he prepared to ascend the Takamikura, he made his decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.A;The time has come for serious reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP24.B;Tranquility must be maintained even in modernity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP25.T;The Start of the Tensho Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP25.D;Know ye, Our subjects, that We shall be known for bringing balance upon this land and seeking the correct form of all things. The time has come for the lands of the Empire to be reconciled with one another, and to vigorously carry out righteous and meritorious conduct. Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything shall be based upon the just laws of Nature. The ensuring of tranquility will be Our foremost goal, and it shall be built upon a strong foundation of knowledge sought throughout the world. The Tensho Emperor has inaugurated an age of constitutionalism. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike have begun to trust the Imperial Court once again. The new Tensho Constitution has transformed Japanese law, while the creation of an Imperial Parliament has sown the seeds of democracy. However, the daimyo still play a powerful role in the nation, with industrial and military connections. Though reformists hope that the door to change has been opened, many wonder if the daimyo will really lose that much power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP25.A;A new day dawns, though the colors are familiar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP26.T;The Start of the Kyowa Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP26.D;Know ye, Our loyal subjects, that we shall be known for following Heaven and taking Our destiny, uniting all people and perfecting Our righteousness. We have come to deliver ye and this land from those who would deprive it of life and vitality. No longer shall We be bound by the constraints of the machinations of men, nor shall We let any man be humbled before the barbarian. Our Ancestors have founded Our Empire on a basis of unbreakable strength and everlasting fidelity, and We call upon you now to fulfill their desires and preserve their inheritance. The time has come for ye, Our subjects, to render illustrious service unto Us. We, the descendant of Ninigi, blessed ruler of Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, he who descended from great Amaterasu-Omikami, are effervescent with heavenly splendor, and shall bring about a new age of glory and righteousness upon all eight corners of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP26.A;Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP27.T;The Heavenly Sovereign's Great Affirmation of Divinity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP27.D;Immediately after his coronation, Tenno Kyowa has begun to make sweeping changes. He has taken an unprecedented interest in politics, demanding regular reports on domestic and foreign affairs, and proclaimed the end of Kaikoku, forcing foreigners into the leased ports. He has established his own political movement, the Kodoha or Imperial Way Faction, which he demands all his subjects must join, while banning all other political parties. Yet these pale in comparison to his most prominent policy, apotheosis. While Shintoism holds that the Tenno is descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu, Tenno Kyowa has made this law. In his Great Affirmation of Divinity, he has made denial of his divine status punishable by death, dissolved the Daijo-Kan, and created the Ministry of Divinity to promulgate his status as the chief god on Earth. By nature of his divine status, he has asserted his right to singular rule. Why, he asks, would a god need the counsel of mortals? Many people, especially daimyo, are starting to chafe at all this;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP27.A;Not, "Emperor," barbarian. Tenno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP28.T;The Hiroshima Memorial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP28.D;Apostasy! Tenno Kyowas rigorous assertion of divine absolutism has finally driven the liberals to treason. A coalition of reformists and other opponents to the Emperor have been recruiting disgruntled daimyo in western Japan for some time. Now, this nest of vipers has issued the Hiroshima Memorial, declaring the Tenno to be insane and to have trespassed beyond the will of Heaven, and have finished by renouncing their oaths of vassalage! Just as old Mitsuhito feared, reformist daimyo have joined with the Jiyuto, with Kyowas liberal cousin Prince Takamado and a recently returned-from-exile Kimimasa becoming the symbolic leaders of this Western Alliance. This is blasphemy, but the reformists command sizable support, not only from their own followers, but from moderates and even some conservatives whom Kyowa has alienated. While State Shinto priests throughout the land declare that defying the Tennos will is heresy, many seem willing to risk damnation to overthrow the Empire. The nation sits on a knife edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP28.A;We shall BURN these heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.T;A Storm Before the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.D;Once again, the clouds of fraternal war have descended upon Japan. Emperor Kyowa seeks to claim the heavens and all beneath them, while the western daimyo have made a desperate pact with the liberals to oppose him under the banner of the Western Alliance. Whoever prevails shall set the course of Japan for the foreseeable future and leave an indelible mark upon its soul. Shall we cast our lot with one of these factions, or shall we seek to weather the storm alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.A;The rebels are our only hope!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.B;We shall be an island within the typhoon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP29.C;The Tenno is our liege and we must serve him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.T;The Second War of the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.D;After the treasonous and blasphemous memorial of the abominable Western Alliance, Tenno Kyowa hoped to decapitate their insurrection by quickly deploying small groups of royal regiments to seize rebellious daimyo. This has backfired tremendously, as these regiments quickly came under attack from the daimyos retainers, who repelled them in short order. After executing the incompetent fools that allowed such a debacle to occur, the Tenno began preparing a larger force, but it seems that the element of surprise has been lost. The Alliance has raised the flag of rebellion and announced their intention to depose the Emperor, as vast swathes of Japan rise up with them. While not all daimyo have joined them, some have declared neutrality, threatening to attack anyone who enters their domains. The future of the Empire is at stake! Shall the holy Tenno Kyowa claim the heavens and all below them or is this the end of his grand design? For the second time in decades, civil war returns to Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.A;Tennhoku Kyowa Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP30.B;The Western Alliance shall end this nightmare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP31.T;An Age of Glory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP31.D;Victory! Tenno Kyowa has crushed the Western Alliance, and his divine and absolute rule has been confirmed. All possible threats to his power, be it from raving republicans, cowardly daimyo, or scurrying so-called moderates, have felt either the cold hard stone of the prison cell or the merciless steel of the executioners blade. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike have accepted their places within the Heaven-ordained Natural order, with the glorious Tenno Kyowa as Heavens appointed leader on Earth. The Ministry of Divinity shall work tirelessly to eradicate false faiths, liberalism shall be annihilated, and foreign thought kept under strict control and oversight. Only the best and most useful outside ideas will be assimilated into our blessed Dai Nippon Teihoku. With the nation finally consolidated under one rule-that of our sacred, unquestionable monarch and his loyal Imperial Court-we may turn our attention and our energies to the borders. Kyowa shall bring all eight corners of the world under one roof!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP31.A;A new day dawns, and the Rising Sun illuminates all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP32.T;Midnight;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP32.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. Honor demands a high price for failure, and as the armies of the Emperor approach the castle, the daimyos own forces shattered and broken, he resolves to revive an old custom to escape the wrath of the mad Kyowa and preserve the last shred of his honor. Dressed in white robes, he tries to savor his final meal before his attendant presents the daimyos tanto knife wrapped in cloth. The blade placed before him, the daimyo calmly composes his last poem, remarking solemnly on the petals of the sakura tree as they fall upon the moonlit water. Then, he consumes a ceremonial cup of sake, as his attendant does likewise. Wrapping the tantos handle in the cloth to maintain his grip, as his attendant stands by and draws his katana, the daimyo opens his kimono, raises the tanto, and pays the price of honor with a left-to-right cut through his abdomen before his attendant delivers the second blow through his neck. Throughout the castle, his samurai follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP32.A;The way of the warrior is to be found in dying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.T;Daybreak;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is over. The clouds of the storm have passed, and Emperor Kyowa stands triumphant. Japan shall surely be reforged in his image, and while he has passed sentence upon all daimyo who rose against him, the fate of those who neither aided nor opposed him is uncertain. While his now-overwhelming strength would seem to dictate that our only option is to renew our oath of vassalage to him, a few of the younger and more hot-headed samurai have urged our daimyo to formally declare independence. They argue that it is better to face the possibility of the Emperors wrath with honor than to meekly submit and once again place the Imperial yoke upon our necks. However, most samurai, older men who remember stories of rebels past, would prefer that the daimyo end his renegade status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.A;Love live the Emperor...may the Heavens help us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP33.B;It is better to die in defiance than to live in submission!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.T;An Age of Rebirth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.D;Victory! The mad emperor has been defeated and his dreams of domination thwarted. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike awake from the nightmare of Kyowas arrogance into the reality of a more just Japan. Already, reformists have begun crafting a new constitution based on the Burgundian model, with a balanced government and separation of powers. The only question now is what path the new Japan shall take. Liberal daimyo want to reshape the monarchy along parliamentary lines and enthrone Prince Takamado as Emperor Meiji, enlightened government, while Kimimasa and the Jiyuto see the monarchy as morally bankrupt and prefer a republic. While many agree that Kyowa has sullied the Chrysanthemum Throne, the idea of ending a millenia-old monarchy is daunting. The bushi seem especially wary of the wave of democracy which has been unleashed, and may cause trouble if the monarchy is dissolved. At the insistence of the moderates, a vote is held among the leaders of the Western Alliance to decide the fate of Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.A;Long live Emperor Meiji, long live parliamentarianism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP34.B;Enough with thrones, let the republicans forge a new Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP35.T;Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP35.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is over, and the rebels have triumphed. Though we have lent our strength to them for this victory, some wonder if their more radical elements might not be keen to reward us. Regardless, the mad Emperor Kyowa has been vanquished, and we may now return to stewarding our domain in Kyotos name, whoever its ruler might be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP35.A;We have chosen well...right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP36.T;Dusk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP36.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. The victorious rebels have now turned to cleaning out all those who served Kyowa. All his agents and sympathizers-Sonno Joi samurai, anti-Kaikoku foreign policy magistrates, kabunakama guild members, the Ministry of Divinity, or reactionary daimyo-are being rooted out. They have had their property seized and been barred from holding office. Unfortunately, my lord, we are among those who faithfully served the Emperor, but now we must pay the price. While some of your more prideful bushi speak of seppuku, and one especially melancholic samurai has already done so, the rebels have announced that you and your family are mercifully allowed to go into exile on the condition that you never set foot in Japan again. We had best leave as soon as possible, before the rebel armies arrive to confiscate your property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP36.A;I hear that Tawantinsuyu is nice this time of year...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP37.T;The Start of the Koshi Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP37.D;Know ye, Our subjects, that we shall be known for broad and vast peace. We have resolved that the disorder that has filled the lands under Heaven shall not be brought forth by Our hands, nor the hands of our most loyal and benevolent subjects. We seek absolute concord, and the furtherance of the tranquility which has always been the dearest wish of Our hearts. The filial honor that binds all of Our subjects to Us, and Us to Our subjects, is an unbreakable cord, and well it be that none seek to strain or sever it. We shall not abide those who seek to plunge these magnificent and abundant lands into tumult, nor those who would pour forth the fountain of rage upon the nations. It shall be with the open hand that Our subjects must embrace and be embraced. The path of ages is beyond the ken of any man, yet its general progression leads irresistibly towards a more perfected society. It is the realization of this condition of national harmony that We ask all of Our subjects to strive towards, for Our sake and for all peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP37.A;...Banzai?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP38.T;The Great Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP38.D;Even before his enthronement, Emperor Koshi had been working on a secretive project. His attendants have brought him books on history, government, and law, and rumors alleged that he even slipped out of the palace in disguise to meet with foreigners! Few believed this, but now, to the horror of the daimyo, Emperor Koshi has issued an unprecedented decree. Known as The Imperial Declaration on Righteous and Reformed Government, or simply the Great Reform, it is a total transformation of the Japanese political system. It contains colossal changes : circumscribing the powers of the Imperial Court, adopting the Kimimasa Draft as the official Japanese constitution, creating an independent legislature and judiciary, sanctioning political parties and public meetings, ending border controls and state censorship, releasing all jailed political activists, disavowing imperialism, banning state funding of religion! It concludes by proclaiming that exiled liberal Kimimasa Yokoi himself is invited to return and be made Prime Minister!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP38.A;He did WHAT!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP39.T;Shogun Mitsuhito;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP39.D;The Great Reform has thrown Japan into chaos. The daimyo are apoplectic with rage towards Koshi, despairing at what they see as national ruination. Now, one man has decided to act. While many opponents of former Prince Regent and current Great Chancellor Mitsuhito, the emperors uncle, had insulted him by dubbing him a Neo-Shogun, few imagined that he would confirm this. However, this morning the Great Chancellor gave an astonishing speech in which he denounced the Emperor as deranged! We must shun the poisoned fruit of Europes blood-soaked republicanism, he declared. Accusing reformists of conspiring with the West, he called for a strong foreign policy and the defense of the kokutai and the kannagara. He capped off this incredible address by invoking his office and his Yamato and Oda heritage to declare himself Shogun and announced his intention to depose the Emperor! With a retinue of reactionary samurai and the support of many daimyo, he has marched on Kyoto, and is approaching the Imperial Palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP39.A;Stop this madman at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP40.T;The Unthinkable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP40.D;Japanese tradition holds that the first emperor of Japan was Emperor Jimmu, whose reign began in 660 B.C. Western historians argue that the first historically verifiable emperor was Emperor Kinmei, whose reign began in 539 A.D. What is notable is that, for one to two thousand years, no emperor of Japan has ever been assassinated. Today, however, an immutable shadow has been cast over all Japanese history. While the pretender Shogun Mitsuhitos army attacked the main royal force stationed outside the palace, he and his retainers were able to infiltrate it. Aided by sympathetic attendants and his knowledge of the palaces shortcuts from his years living within it, he easily made his way to the throne room. Demanding Emperor Koshis immediate abdication, he grew angry when the Emperor politely but firmly refused. In the struggle with the royal guards which followed, the Koshi emperor attempted to escape, but his uncle showed no mercy and committed a cataclysmic transgression. Emperor Koshi has been assassinated by Mitsuhito!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP40.A;And a rage in Heaven shall surely follow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP41.T;Kegare;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP41.D;Kegare is the Shinto conception of spiritual impurity, and Mitsuhito seems to have immersed himself in it. With Emperor Koshi newly dead, Mitsuhito has held the briefest of funerals to mark his passing, before coronating himself as Emperor, under the regnal name of Showa, Heavenly Peace. News of the slaying, however, has spread like wildfire, and vast swathes of Japan are beside themselves with fury. Many accuse Tenno Showa of having committed the first Japanese regicide, not just against the Emperor for whom Mitsuhito was regent but against his own nephew. Daimyo and bushi across the land decry him as a demon incarnate. Many daimyo have rallied under Prince Konoe, Showas cousin and a pragmatist. Konoe has denounced Showa as a megalomaniacal kinslayer and has vowed to oust him and create a sensible monarchy. Meanwhile, Admiral Yusumoto Hideki has emerged from retirement to lead an army of radicals and bushi against Showa, declaring monarchism unsalvageable and calling for a republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP41.A;Do these fools not understand that this was a necessary evil?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.T;A Storm Before the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.D;Once again, the clouds of fraternal war have descended upon Japan. Emperor Showa has shattered every law of man and kami in his quest for absolute power, while both the moderates and the radicals have chosen leaders to bear their standards against the Chrysanthemum Throne. Whoever prevails shall set the course of Japan for the foreseeable future and leave an indelible mark upon its soul. We must cast our lot with one of these factions, but which one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP42.A;The revolution has arrived!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP42.C;The Emperor is our liege and we must serve him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP43.T;The Second War of the Rising Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP43.D;As soon as Tenno Showa heard that Konoe and Yusumoto had risen against him, he called upon all those still loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne to resist the rebels and serve their emperor. Though some have obeyed, many more have shunned him for committing the unforgivable sin of assassinating Emperor Koshi, his own blood relative. While the daimyo and bushi of Japan might have been outraged by Koshis policies, few went so far as to call for his head, and Showas shockingly brutal usurpation has shattered the nation. Japan is now splintered between those who serve the Emperor, right or wrong, and those who cannot abide by Showas actions. The moderate monarchists and the radical republicans have both declared their intention to claim all of Japan for their respective causes. As daimyo consider joining one of these factions or fortifying their domains and declaring neutrality, the nation braces for yet more blood to be shed in the name of the Rising Sun. For the second time in decades, civil war returns to Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP44.D;Victory! Emperor-no, enough of that barbarian word! TENNO Showa, Heavenly Sovereign Showa, has crushed all opposition, and his control of the Chrysanthemum Throne is secure. Across the country, commoner and daimyo alike have accepted Showa as their sovereign, even if they do so only because of our bushi patrolling their villages. Both Konoe and Yusumoto have failed to conquer Japan, and their movements have melted before our might. As we speak, Tenno Showas forces are sweeping through the nation, and all traitors shall be duly punished. Our officers assure Tenno Showa that the scourge of liberal democracy has been eradicated. The time might have come for the Dai Nippon Taihoku to enter modernity, but the kokutai shall not be destroyed in the process. With the legitimacy of Tenno Showa now beyond all reasonable doubt, Japan may finally turn its attention and its energies to its borders. We shall prove ourselves worth of the glory which the Heavens have bestowed upon us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP45.T;Midnight;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP45.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. Honor demands a high price for failure, and as the armies of the Emperor approach the castle, the daimyos own forces shattered and broken, he resolves to revive an old custom to escape the wrath of the vile Showa and preserve the last shred of his honor. Dressed in white robes, he tries to savor his final meal before his attendant presents the daimyos tanto knife wrapped in cloth. The blade placed before him, the daimyo calmly composes his last poem, remarking solemnly on the petals of the sakura tree as they fall upon the moonlit water. Then, he consumes a ceremonial cup of sake, as his attendant does likewise. Wrapping the tantos handle in the cloth to maintain his grip, as his attendant stands by and draws his katana, the daimyo opens his kimono, raises the tanto, and pays the price of honor with a left-to-right cut through his abdomen before his attendant delivers the second blow through his neck. Throughout the castle, his samurai follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP46.T;An Age of Liberty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP46.D;Victory! We have defeated the despicable kinslayer who dared to call himself Emperor Showa, as well as the militant republicans. Prince Konoe has been enthroned as Emperor, taking the regnal name of Heisei, or Peace Everywhere. This name is indeed a great longing for the Japanese people, who wish to restore harmony after decades of chaos. Considering this, Emperor Heisei has proven to be a greater ally of the reformists than many expected, promising to work with them and even proclaiming the formation of an Imperial Parliament. While Heisei has claimed to oppose radicalism, the fact that he has left much of Koshis Great Reform in place has shocked many conservatives, though the bushis defeat seems to have shattered their political power. Most of his subjects can hardly complain about having a pragmatic Emperor, considering his predecessor. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike are looking towards the future with renewed hope. Perhaps the unity which has been so out of reach in years past may finally be at hand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP48.D;The Second War of the Rising Sun is concluded, and we have lost. The victorious rebels have now turned to cleaning out all those who served Showa or Yusumoto. All their agents and sympathizers-Sonno Joi samurai, ambitious military officers, kabunakama guild members, or opportunistic daimyo-are being rooted out. They have had their property seized and been barred from holding office. Unfortunately, my lord, we are among those who faithfully served their enemies, but now we must pay the price. While some of your more prideful bushi speak of seppuku, and one especially melancholic samurai has already done so, the rebels have announced that you and your family are mercifully allowed to go into exile on the condition that you never set foot in Japan again. We had best leave as soon as possible, before the rebel armies arrive to confiscate your property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP49.T;An Age of Bravery;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP49.D;Victory! The bushi have defied the odds and created a bold new Japanese Republic. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike behold a nation in the hands of its greatest defenders. The first order of business was the public execution of the false kinslaying emperor-Showa might have thought himself blessed by Heaven, but the executioners blade and the crematorium thought otherwise. This has been taken badly by those already reeling from one Imperial death, creating instability. Furthermore, many reformists seem wary of a revolution imposed by the bushi. Tragically, Admiral Yusumoto perished in battle, leaving his successors to guide the nation. His lieutenant, Saigo Ryoma, has been appointed President pending new elections. Few would have imagined samurai leading the revolution, but we have realized our true role as the stewards of Japan, and we shall both advance its interests and protect its heritage. Under the firm yet benevolent hand of democracy, Japan shall reap untold riches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP52.D;Astonishing news has reached us-Japan has plunged into civil war! The details are difficult to gather, but apparently the death of the previous Emperor and the enthronement of his son and heir caused difficulties owing to the character and conduct of his successor. This has caused all semblance of Japanese rule in Joseon to crumble, as Japanese administrators find their communications with Kyoto severed. As Japan leaps once more into the fire, Korean sovereignty has been restored, but we should not be quick to rejoice. The northern bandit army which has the audacity to call itself Goryeo, and which also claims to be the true government of Korea, will surely strike against us now that the mailed hand of Japans imperial rule no longer checks them. It seems that our newfound freedom will already need to be defended. And of course, if and when Japan emerges from their conflict, our reconquest will probably be one of their first priorities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP53.D;Wonderful news has reached us-Japan has plunged back into civil war! The details are difficult to gather, but apparently the death of yet another one of their delusional emperors and the enthronement of his wretched spawn caused difficulties owing to the heirs presumably wicked personality. This has caused the cowardly Japanese colony to find its puppet-strings severed, as Japanese administrators find their chauvinism brought low by the righteous anger of the long-oppressed Goryeonminjok. But, enough talk, now is the time for action! The pretenders in the south have already organized a preposterous regime that is the obvious inheritor of Japans colonial legacy. There is no time to waste, we must march south and unite the peninsula before the Japanese beast returns. For a free and whole Goryeo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

After failing to convince the government to pass the Tozama Plan to preserve the samurai, Hozumi resigned, returned home, and founded a private military academy for fellow dissatisfied bushi. The news that these samurai had begun to acquire government positions across Tokushima, however, disturbed us, and soldiers were sent to investigate, as well as to secure the local arsenal. What happened next is disputed, but his supporters claim that soldiers attempted to arrest Hozumi, and his students retaliated, violently expelling them.

It seems, however, that he chose to levy his own punishment upon himself. We found his headless corpse by the seaside, near the site of the last battle, his own blade buried in his stomach. According to a fisherman who observed the battle, Hozumi committed seppuku when the battle was clearly lost, and his attendant, after performing the customary decapitation, flung his head into the sea to prevent the government from being able to conclusively prove his death. This marks the end of the samurai as both a military and a political force in Japan, but the people seem to already be marveling at what they see as a martyred hero and even whisper of him escaping to places like Tawantinsuyu or China. Most of our government scoff at such romanticizing of an embittered rebel, but it seems that Hozumi has won one final battle : the battle for his memory, and that of the samurai.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP64.A;Scholar Nomura Ujikore has always had a reputation for rather strange ideological positions. Having led a group of liberals into the northern mountains to escape the previous governments violent purge of reformists, Nomura only grew more radical in isolation. Upon return, his advocacy for social and gender equality made him many enemies, yet also led some to see Nomura as the last true republican. His base of support is the city of Edo, where officials had noted with concern the growing membership among workers in Nomuras so-called Free Press Party, a group which has long been suspected as being a front for much more serious radicalism. This proved correct, as Nomura and a small army of followers have taken advantage of a small-scale dockworker strike to launch a rebellion! Armed cadres have seized control of Edo and stormed city hall, where Nomura has read a speech in which he has denounced the government as the boot stamping upon the necks of the people, and called for revolution! The revolt is already spreading beyond Edo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Though he attempted to commit suicide with a revolver, Captain Tanaka Hayato quickly disarmed and arrested him. By they time they emerged, the city was retaken, and Nomura was brought back to the capital for trial. Representing himself, Nomura spent most of his time railing against the government, denouncing it for blithely inheriting the cruel attitudes of the past. Convicted for treason, he was brought before a firing squad in the capital barracks.

NJAP65.T;The End of the Leased Ports;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP65.D;Over the last few hundred years, our nations influence in Japan grew so great among local daimyo that we were able to negotiate the lease of a port city, which became an important enclave. Nagasaki and Yokohama were, along with Osaka, the only truly free-trade ports in Japan, and renowned centers of intellectual and cultural exchange in addition to their status as economic hubs. However, despite this being a negotiated agreement, the Japanese have always felt uneasy about foreigners holding their lands, and it seems that the Japanese government has finally decided not to renew our lease. Their representatives assure us that they will obey the terms of the leases early termination clause and reimburse us, though our lawyers protest that exchange rates have changed dramatically since the contract was written and this sum is far lower than what they ought to pay. Regardless, at this point they seem dead set on reclaiming the ports, and to resist them would mean war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

While our officials have prepared emergency evacuation plans to our holdings in Liusung, also known as Tondo, to do this would be a highly traumatic and humiliating affair.

NJAP68.D;Saigo Ryoma, famous general and founding member of the new regime, has gained a reputation for shrewdness, but he seems to have grown disillusioned with partisanship and decided that the time has come to end the democratic experiment. Today, flanked by stone-faced guards, he read out a pronouncement from the steps of the former Imperial Palace, declaring himself Gensui or Marshall and suspending the legislature! This has upended the nation, as Saigo had been trusted to use his influence to keep the military apolitical, not use it to seize power. While most of the military has been quick to pledge allegiance to Saigo, certain bushi have lambasted him for declining to restore the samurai to prominence, while the liberals are aghast at this demolition of Japans nascent democracy. The Gensui has already declared his intent to restore conservatism, which has not helped matters. With stirrings of rebellion and conspiracy in both the east and the west of the nation, it seems that Japan has not escaped the storm clouds yet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP69.T;The Saigo Affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NJAP69.D;Disaster was averted today, as several Parliamentary MPs were presented with incontrovertible evidence of a conspiracy led by famous general Saigo Ryoma to seize control of the nation and proclaim himself dictator! After the MPs contacted liberal and trustworthy members of the military to assist them, Saigo and his accomplices were taken by surprise in their homes and immediately made to resign all government positions before being arrested. To prevent panic, the evidence of the conspiracy has been released and distributed among the public, who are shocked but also relieved that the coup was prevented. However, the fact that Saigo was a samurai, and that samurai were heavily involved in his plan, has cast a shadow of suspicion upon them. With the samurai already weakened by the governments emphasis on military modernization, radicals are beginning to vilify them as arch-reactionary parasites, infuriating the bushi. Worst of all, it is feared that not all conspirators were identified and may still be at large;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP70.D;Though the republic was built on a fragile basis of cooperation between liberal scholars and ideologically diverse samurai, it had been hoped that this unlikely coalition could be as successful in peace as it was in war. Sadly, this was not to be. A famous samurai named Hozumi Takemori, once seen as a moderating influence among the bushi, has moved sharply to the right since the republics establishment. Fearful of liberalism eroding Japanese culture, he has decided that the fate of the nation cannot be trusted to intellectuals. With the support of samurai across the nation, especially those within the military and the rest of the government, Hozumi has marched on the capital and proclaimed himself to be the new president. He has already issued executive orders resurrecting State Shinto, banning political parties, and implementing various other policies which have horrified liberals. Yet reactionaries and even conservatives seem to adore him, none more so than the bushi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NJAP71.D;Like the bakemono of Shintoism, the fickle shapeshifting spirits of terrible power, Japan has morphed from a republic into something beyond recognition. The growing tensions between liberal intellectuals and the ideologically diverse samurai proved irreconcilable, and the bushi have decided to act. Prince Fujitaka, a Shinto zealot and youngest brother of former Prince Regent Mitsuhito, fled into exile after the republican victory in the civil war. However, after being contacted by conspiratorial bushi, he has returned in secret. During a meeting of the legislature, the bushi overpowered the guards and burst into the chamber, slaughtering all within. Minutes later, Fujitaka entered Kyoto in a grand parade escorted by the highest members of the military, heading straight to the Imperial Palace where he was enthroned as Emperor-Shogun Kanei. /n /n Know ye, Our subjects, that We shall be known for the Broad Leniency given unto us as your Eternal Leader.

FJAP1.D;Father Francisco Garrupe was a Portuguese Jesuit priest who helped spread Catholicism to Japan. Prior to his arrival in 1639, his mentor, Joao Ferreira, was rumored to have been executed by the Shimabara daimyo, Arima Yukinaga, and Garrupe infiltrated Shimabara to investigate. After narrowly escaping arrest, he found a samurai named Kirino Hanjiro, who was himself a Kirishitan (secret Christian). Hanjiro confirmed Ferreiras death before sneaking out of Shimabara to inform Shogun Oda Nobunaga of the situation. Garrupe was soon then captured, tortured, and martyred by Yukinaga. However, Nobunaga, upon hearing Hanjiros story, forced Yukinaga to abdicate. The daimyos heir Ieyasu, moved by Garrupes actions, converted to Catholicism and spread the faith across Shimabara. Many Japanese Catholics have pressed for Garrupes canonization, and now the Holy Father has finally seen fit to declare him a saint. Joyous crowds greeted the news in Nagasaki - a port leased by Ieyasu to Spain, and a center of Asian Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW1.T;Voyage of the Dingyuan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW1.D;Marshall Yeng Futing is the rightful leader of both our humble archipelago of Fang Hú and of Qingqiu. Beginning as the advisor to the Admiral of the Council of Twenty in 1809, he took control of the fleet during the Unification of Qingqiu in 1812 and refused to bow to the new federation government in Sanbao. Although he had been sure of being welcomed by fellow opponents of the Sanbao leviathan, no city opened its harbor to him, and so he embarked to the islands of Hawai, at the time known as Jarlsbergsøyene in Europe and which was going through its own unification war. Futing brought peace and stability to his new realm of Fang Hú, which he has governed ever since. One of his first decrees was an embargo against traitorous Qingqiu, but last night a Qinqiuese ship, the Dingyuan, attempted to smuggle goods into Fang Hú! Fortunately the virtuous Fleet-in-Exile drove them off, but this is yet another reminder that we must not forget our dangerous position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW1.A;Qingqiu, we have not forgotten you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW2.T;Incident in Fang Hú;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW2.D;Hawaii is an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean, distant from most trade routes. For the past few decades, the islands have been ruled as Fang Hú by Marshall Yeng Futing, a treasonous Qingqiuese naval officer who took command of the rebel fleet in the aftermath of the War of Unification in 1812, then fled to the islands and brutally subjugated them. While some in Qingqiu have argued that our nation has a moral duty to end Futings reign, the remoteness of the islands and their lack of strategic value have made them a low priority. However, the nature of their government means that they continue to grab headlines on occasion. This time, a merchant ship named the Dingyuan attempted to anchor off the coast of Fang Hú to conduct business there, only to be chased away by the outsized Fang Hú navy. This incident has once again brought Fang Hú into national discourse, and while public attention will probably fade, the situation remains a nagging issue for Qingqius foreign policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW2.A;What a bizarre situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW3.T;House Kalanikupule Escapes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW3.D;The Kalanikupule family, long the rulers of the island of Maui, were, like most native dynasties of Fang Hú, reduced to mere figureheads under the close eye of the Marshalls forces. Kept under house arrest and tight surveillance except during major ceremonies, control of the islands ruling families strengthened Futings rule. It appears, however, that these security measures have finally failed. Last night, after what was, according to an interrogated household servant, months of planning, the Kalanikupules gathered their most precious belongings and subdued the guards posted to the night watch of their state-furnished palace. Stealing out into the night, they were met at the shore by a launch from a ship, which carried them away and allowed them to make a rapid escape before the Navy could even be notified. According to the lighthouse keeper who reported the incident, the ship that bore them was flying the Scandinavian flag! This has led to rumors swirling that the whole thing was a Scandinavian plot;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW3.A;Fetch the guards that were supposed to watch them - and a firing squad while you're at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW4.T;Flight of the House Kalanikupule;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW4.D;A strange tale has reached us from our Christiana colony. A few days ago, one of our Eastern Indies Fleets ships, the Hansa, was reported missing, yet Admiral Christian Knuth, head of the Fleet, seemed oddly unconcerned. The whole colony was astonished when the Hansa returned yesterday bearing an entire Jarlsbergsøyenese royal family! Apparently, Protestant missionaries approached Knuth months ago, describing how they had secretly converted members of the Kalanikupule dynasty of Maui Island to Christianity. However, the major families of Jarlsbergsøyene, also known as Fang Hú or Hawaii, were under house arrest by the islands despot, a rogue Qingqiuese admiral named Yeng Futing. Knuth secretly dispatched the Hansa to aide the Jarlsbergsøyenese in an uprising against Futing. It arrived too late, and the uprising failed, but the Hansa was still able to rescue the dynasty. Some ministers are shocked at Knuths recklessness, though others observe that we could use this to our advantage by installing them as rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW4.A;Very well, don't court marshal him - yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW5.T;Death of the Marshall;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW5.D;Yeng Futing, great Marshall of Qingqiu and the island of Fang Hú has died. Beginning as the advisor to the Admiral of the Council of Twenty in 1809, he took control of the fleet during the Unification of Qingqiu in 1812 and refused to bow to the new federation government in Sanbao. With no city revolting to welcome his ships, he embarked to the islands of Hawai, at the time known as Jarlsbergsøyene in Europe and which was going through its own unification wars. The Qingqiuese admiral decimated the warring chiefs and their retinues, establishing an oligarchy where only the Qingqiuese officers had power. Futing claimed to be the only true ruler of Qingqiu, although no one took him seriously. His unopposed rule lasted more than 50 years, and already it seems that both the native Hawaians who have become increasingly radicalized due to the harsh treatments imposed by the Chinese oligarchy, and the Qingqiuese settlers want some change in the islands. One wonders how the designated successor of Yeng, Zhang Chen, will handle this new era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW5.A;A drama in the heart of the Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.T;Cabinet Discusses Jarlsbergsøyene;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.D;With the death of the notorious Marshall Yeng Futing, our ministers and military officers have begun to debate whether we should intervene in  Jarlsbergsøyene. Admiral Knuths actions have ensured that we have a justification, should we want one : placing the Kalanikupule dynasty on the throne of a united archipelago. The larger question is whether doing so might attract unwanted attention. Qingqiu has always seen Fang Hú as part of its diplomatic sphere, albeit a renegade one, and decades of Qingqiuese rule have created a notable minority which wields tremendous political and economic power, so they might also intervene. But, our admirals point to a third contender : the Empire of Japan. Japans ambitions in the Pacific are well known, and Futing had occasionally allowed Japanese traders to conduct business in Fang Hú, so they have established a small presence there as well. While Japan is currently unstable, it is probable that they would react if we moved against Jarlsbergsøyene. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.A;Drop the matter, it isn't worth our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW6.B;We must liberate Jarlsbergsøyene!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW7.T;Marshal Chen Supports Qingqiuese Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW7.D;With the lack of any forthcoming Scandinavian intervention against Fang Hú, Marshal Zhang Chen assembled the high-ranking military officers and most influential landlords at his palace today, and made a stunning announcement : he intends to convince Qingqiu to annex us! He followed this thunderbolt by explaining his motives  if Fang Hú joins Qingqiu on its own terms, Chen said, then they could obtain Qingqius protection while presenting themselves as a ready-made administration for Sanbao to co-opt. Thus, the ruling elite could preserve much of their power and no longer live in fear of foreign encroachment. This explanation soothed most attendees nerves, though the military is restless at the thought of surrendering our independence to the nation that Futing spend fifty years railing against. Still, word has already leaked out into the public, and most Qingqiuese settlers seem to approve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW7.A;It's time to go home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.T;Fang Hú Requests Annexation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.D;Our government was caught off guard when Marshall Zhang Chen, the newest ruler of Fang Hú, sent an envoy to us to request to join our nation! Apparently, the measure has gained rapid support in the archipelago following Futings death, and a recent incident with Scandinavia convinced Chen that foreign protection is necessary to safeguard Fang Hú. With a powerful Qingqiuese settler population already existing in Fang Hú, it would probably be simple to integrate them into our country. Several expansionist MPs have quickly drafted a bill of annexation and ensured its swift passage through the legislature, and today Fang Hú became our newest state. The mood was not entirely jubilant, however, as dark rumors have emerged that the Empire of Japan may seek to interfere;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.A;We shall sign the bill into law and celebrate our new Pacific friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW8.B;A tremendous gesture, but we cannot risk Japan's wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.T;Hojo is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.D;To the astonishment of our ministers, both Scandinavia and Qingqiu have shied away from taking control of the Hojo Islands, despite being presented opportunities to do so. Qingqiu is reported to have even voted down a bill of annexation! With no other option and fearing for the future of the archipelago, Marshall Chen has reluctantly approached us and requested our protection. Though he and much of his family will maintain positions of influence across the islands, we have effectively gained control of Hojo without firing a shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.A;A bloodless victory is the most sublime kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW9.B;Those islands are clearly more trouble than they're worth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.T;The Hojo Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.D;The archipelago of Hojo  known to westerners as Jarlsbergsøyene, to Chinese speakers as Fang Hú, and to natives as Hawaii  has been the object of small Japanese interest for decades. Japan was a major trading partner in Fang Hú and sanctioned by its mercurial Qinqiuese dictator, the rogue admiral Yeng Futing. While our merchant activity was strictly regulated by Futing and his oligarchs, we nevertheless managed to build up a trading presence there. Now, however, our position has been threatened, as the nation of Qingqiu recently passed a bill of Fang Húese annexation! If we want to avoid surrendering our position in Hojo  and potentially opening up nearby Pacific islands to Qingqiuese colonization  we must act swiftly to oppose them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.A;We shall not bow to a nation as lowly as Qingqiu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW10.B;Let us reconcile with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW11.T;Japan Declares War over Fang Hú!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW11.D;When our forefathers smashed the Xiazhou Expedition, the Japanese invasion of Qingqiu, in 4528 Huángdì year (1821 AD by the European calendar), they had warned us that this was not the end  that Japan might one day return. Now, those fears have been proven correct, albeit in a way they likely couldnt have anticipated. Our annexation of the Fang Hú Islands has provoked the gluttonous Japanese so severely that they have declared war upon us, with the seizure of Fang Hú as their goal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW11.A;They shall meet the same fate as before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW12.T;Japan Forfeits Fang Hú;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW12.D;It seems that the Japanese are even more cowardly than we thought. Though they have issued strenuous diplomatic protests over our annexation of Fang Hú, there has not been any sign of them taking military action against us. The islands are ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW12.A;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW13.T;The End of the Oligarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW13.D;Yeng Futing had always insisted on a firm hand when dealing with the native peoples of Fang Hú, declaring that they would seize any moment of weakness to rise up, even as he demeaned them as primitive savages. It seems that he was right to be paranoid. Just before dawn this morning, a strike force of three Scandinavian men-of-war pulled into Hilo harbor, cannons blazing. In the confusion of the assault, Scandinavian marines travelled north by boat away from the heat of the fighting, then made landfall and snuck into the city. Just as Marshall Chen was informed of the invasion, the marines  led by Prince 'Iolani Kalanikupule  fought their way into the palace and took Chen by surprise as he was escaping. Chen died in a shootout in the palace gardens, and soon Scandinavian reinforcements arrived to secure the capital. News of the invasion spread across the islands, igniting a deluge of native uprisings which have shattered the Qingqiuese dominion. 'Iolani has been enthroned as King of a united Hawaii, backed by Scandinavian firepower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW13.A;Aloha, Hawaii!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW14.T;Pro-Scandinavian Coup in Fang Hú!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW14.D;Traders operating in the South China Sea had brought back rumors of a Scandinavian plot to restore native Hawaiian rule in Fang Hú, and it seems that these rumors were correct. Scandinavian warships blasted their way into the capital city of Hilo, shattering the vaunted Fleet-in-Exile and allowing a team of marines led by a Hawaiian prince to execute Marshall Zhang Chen and initiate an archipelago-wide revolution against the Qingqiuese settlers. The islands of Hawaii, as it is now known, have been united under this new King Iolani, and his nation is now firmly in the Scandinavian sphere. Expansionists across Qingqiu are already calling upon us to save the Qingqiuese of the islands, and rescue them from what can only be the prelude to full Scandinavian annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
HAW14.A;The Qingqiuese flag shall fly over the Pacific!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The islands of Hawaii, as it is now known, have been united under this new King Iolani, and his nation is now firmly in the Scandinavian sphere. Our traders have already begun returning to Japan, demanding that the government take action to defend both Japanese economic rights and our national honor, and the navy seems quite sympathetic to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

HAW16.D;Prince  now King  Iolani was quite happy with our governments vast amount of military aid supplied to enthrone him as the first native monarch of the Jarlsbergsøyenese islands, but perhaps he should have read the fine print of our agreement a bit more closely. A Scandinavian resident has been appointed to oversee the Kingdoms affairs, Scandinavian merchants have been granted extraordinary privileges throughout the archipelago, and, since the Fang Hú military was largedly arrested or killed during the anti-Qingqiuese revolution, the only truly organized military presence on the islands is the Scandinavian military. With no sign of foreign interference in sight, there is little reason to maintain the fiction of native rule any longer. Iolani may keep his title, informally, but he and his dynasty shall once more be figureheads within the new Jarlsbergsøyenese protectorate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The Qingqiuese have expressed outrage at our invasion of Fang Hú  never mind that it was done to overthrow the regime that had been their enemy for over half a century.

HAW24.D;Though Qingqiu sought to restore the settlers dominion over Hawaii, though Scandinavia schemed to deprive it of its liberty, though Japan made plans to conquer it, King Iolani Kalanikupule has outsmarted them all. Knowing that the only thing more tempting than a subjugated Hawaii was denying their rivals a victory, he bet on all three powers mutual distrust  and won. In the Conference of Honolulu, attended by all three powers as well as the King and his council, and which shall go down in the annals of diplomatic history, Hawaii has become a truly neutral nation. Though the King has renounced the nations right to wage war or to enter military alliances, in return he has obtained international recognition of Hawaii as a nation safeguarded by international law. Furthermore, Japan, Qingqiu, and Scandinavia have all renounced their claims to the islands, and have mutually guaranteed its independence. As the signatories put pen to page, King Iolani declared that Hawaii and its guarantors were now an ohana, a family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The chaos that this provoked inspired Japan to attempt to seize the coastal region of Xiazhou. The expedition was a disaster  our logistics proved totally inadequate, every European power with any influence in Arcadia aided the Qingqiuans against us, and the daring attempt by Admiral Yusumotos marines to seize the harbor in preparation for taking the city itself led to a vicious street battle in which his whole unit was annihilated. The wounds of this shame upon both the honor of our military and the honor of our nation have never healed. Now, however, the situation has changed.

Though most famous for their spectacular flora and fauna, control of Kamejima would give us an outpost in the southern Pacific and serve as a base to further expand our influence in Ameriga and Arcadia. It just so happens that a small Japanese merchant ship is scheduled to pass by the Galapagos on its way to an Amerigan port.

In short, the Andagoya Canal must be prevented from being built, by any means necessary. Andagoya is currently autonomous but controlled by another power, a situation which we can exploit. We have contacted a noteworthy Andagoyan politician, one Juan Eligio Mallarino, who is known to be both ambitious and corrupt. He has agreed to lead a pro-Japanese coup in Andagoya, so long as we ensure a prominent place for him in the forthcoming administration. Of course, Andagoyas overlord might be able to thwart Mallarino, and if that happens then war will be our only other option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

reorganize_andagoya_desc;With Andagoya in our hands, it is time to reorganize the region to suit our interests. Mallarino shall be rewarded for his services by being crowned Grand Protector of Andagoya  under vassalage to the holy Tenno, of course. A new Andagoyan government shall be formed, one built upon tradition and friendly to Japanese interests, starting with new laws to protect the Japanese kokutai in Andagoya. A strip of territory in central Andagoya shall be annexed directly to Japan, not to build a canal as the delusional barbarians dream of but instead to safeguard the region and protect it from such mad schemes. To emphasize this point, we shall declare a moratorium on any measures to construct an Andagoyan Canal, effective immediately. This may shock the barbarians but their insolence is meaningless compared to protecting the future of Andagoya and of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

end_andagoya_moratorium_desc;Japans brash seizure of Andagoya and their shocking ban upon the construction of an Andagoyan canal is a threat not simply to the Andagoyan people, but to the very concepts of scientific progress and freedom of trade. We cannot allow Japan to dictate international laws! The occupation of Andagoya by Japan and the rule of their preening puppet Grand Protector must end immediately. We shall present an ultimatum to the Japanese government : evacuate Andagoya and restore democratic rule, or face war. §RThe magnitude of this demand is such that if Japan refuses then we shall not be able to back down.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Situated on the northern coast of the East Indies, its proximity to both the Rusun Islands and mainland southeast Asia makes it a vital port for any power seeking to establish a naval presence in the region  such as ourselves. However, it has begun to fall into disrepair over the years, as the Spanish authorities find themselves without either the money or the energy to revitalize the region.

Its proximity to Takasago makes it the logical next line of defense, its resources would be of substantial value to our economy, and its acquisition would open the way to our consolidation of the whole archipelago. Yet Rusun is currently held by a foreign power, one who is not inclined to part with it. This cannot stand! Rusun must be Japanese  but the Japanese people seem to be unaware of Rusuns importance.

the_kyowakai_society_desc;The Kyowakai (Concordia) Society is a group which seeks to bring businessmen, political theorists, and military officers together in the support of Japans interests in continental Asia, chiefly China. The men of the Kyowakai Society argue that Chinas state of disorder, compared to Japans newfound unity, is proof that the Chinese have lost the ability to maintain a harmonious and peaceful realm. Moreover, the intrusion of European Great Powers into Chinas economy (and, lately, their coastal territory) is a threat to the Asian balance of power and to Japans financial stability. The Kyowakai Society seeks to advance Japanese hegemony as the solution to these problems  whether by diplomatic pressure, propaganda, or subterfuge, they shall stop at nothing to secure our position in China. For the greater good, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through the newspapers, politicians, merchants, and agents at the societys disposal, they will engineer a burst of public support for our cause which will culminate in an international incident between us and a foreign power that holds a vulnerable Chinese city. The international community might be suspicious, but it shall give us a solid justification for war.

call_nagoya_conference _trade_desc;Tensions in China are reaching a fever pitch. With European powers continuing to jockey for influence, not to mention the shifting political situation within China itself, East Asian trade is growing unstable. To solve this crisis, let us convene a diplomatic conference in the city of Nagoya for all of the powers involved in the China trade. The solution which Japan shall propose? Simple : as the foremost Asian power, one built upon the foundation of democracy and with few stakes in Europes affairs, we are the most reliable guardian of East Asian trade and thus should be recognized as its guarantor. Obviously, this would necessitate our taking control of the Chinese cities most involved in the East Asian economy, but this is strictly to prevent further violence. Suffice to say, this is likely to be a difficult concept for the Great Powers to accept, but so long as we publicize the concept we should have a solid foundation for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
embrace_sangoku_doctrine_title;The Sangoku Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
embrace_sangoku_doctrine_trade_desc;Sangoku (lit. Three Countries) is a concept which has existed in Japanese philosophy from before contact with Europe. It identifies Honshu (the largest island in Japan), Kara (China), and Tenjiku (India) as part of a single spiritual and cultural continuum. However, the phrase has begun to be used by Japanese political scientists to describe something more complex, namely Japans obligation to culturally unite Asia and dismantle European colonialism throughout the continent. These pan-Asianists argue that Japan, having thrown off the shackles of theocratic monarchy and feudalism while still maintaining our unique national character, has achieved a level of cultural development above that of Europe. Therefore, we ought to take the lead and guide Asia into common prosperity. Naturally, adopting this as government policy will outrage Europe  but, let them howl! Asia is for Asians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the_southern_embassy_desc;The Southern Embassy is one of Japans most venerable diplomatic offices, the one located in the overseas Chinese state of Zhourao. One of the most distant outposts of Japanese trade, Japanese-Zhourao relations have been complicated by both the distance involved and the cultural disconnection between our societies. Yet as both Japan and Zhourao begin to recognize a greater sense of national responsibility, perhaps we could find a common purpose in securing stability within the Pacific Ocean. We shall attempt to form a military alliance with Zhourao  if they accept then it may enable us to greatly increase our influence in their nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_zuharra_agreement_title;Propose the Pact of Kagoshima;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the_zuharra_agreement_desc;Japan has maintained diplomatic and economic connections with the southern overseas Chinese state of Zhourao for centuries, but most of these ties have been of little importance. However, the arrival of a European colonial power onto the continent and its occupation of the region of Zuharra has cast our relations with Zhourao in a new light. Our military believes that we may be able to sway the Zhourao government into forming a military alliance for the purpose of driving out the Europeans and securing Zuharra for Zhourao. If successful, then we may be able to ingratiate ourselves within the Zhourao military, as well as its political and economic elite. Perhaps those connections could, in turn, open up the possibility of establishing a more...friendly Zhourao regime. Let us draw in a group of visiting Zhourao diplomats into the city of Kagoshima for a series of secret discussions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

puppet_zhourao_desc;Our liberation of Zuharra has made Japan quite celebrated in Zhourao. However, it has not only brought us popularity  it has also given us the chance to make valuable connections with Zhouraos military, political, and economic establishment. We have drawn the most Japanophilic  Zhourao elite into a single organization, the Chrysanthemum Society (named for a flower often associated with Japan). This Society has extolled Japans virtues in public, but in private has been preparing for a coup to create a government more favorable to Japans interests. In exchange, all members of the Society shall find themselves handsomely rewarded after the revolution. We have just received word that the plan is ready to be put into action. Of course, if it fails, the Zhourao people will be outraged. and we shall likely be drawn into open warfare with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

conquer_zhourao_desc;Zhourao is a land which at first glance seems to be barren, but which in truth holds tremendous riches. Whoever possesses Zhourao shall find wealth beyond imagination, if they can endure its hazards. Yet Zhourao is currently possessed by a dishonorable and undeserving people, barbaric Chinese settlers who have squatted upon the land for generations, and who have cobbled together a feeble edifice that they dare to call a government. The time has come for the great Japanese people to sweep this flotsam back into the sea where it came from, and take the mighty southern continent for ourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC1.T;Victory in Xiazhou!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC1.D;At last, the humiliation of the past has been avenged! Qingqiu has been driven from Xiazhou and they have finally conceded that the war is lost. The Qingqiuans have signed a peace treaty ceding Xiazhou to us, and the only question now is what to do with it. Hokkaigan has petitioned us to place the area under their control, citing their geographic proximity and the history of Hokkaiganese fishermen, hunters, and traders ranging south into Xiazhou (one of the sources for our claim on the area in the first place). However, a few morecautious members of the military have proposed maintaining direct rule over Xiazhou. They argue that, should Qingqiu retaliate or Hokkaigan repudiate their allegiance in the future, having a Japanese garrison in the area would be preferable. Still, these men are a tiny minority and most officials agree that Hokkaigan should receive the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC2.D;As the last guns fall silent across western Arcadia, the banner of Qingqiu is nowhere to be seen  the Rising Sun dominates all, from the verdant forests of Xiazhou to the vast city of Sanbao. The question of the hour is how we shall administer these newly conquered lands. The current plan is to create a client state known as Dayan to control the interior of Qingqiu, controlled by Japanese officials but employing sufficiently vetted and obedient Qingqiuans, one of whom would rule Dayan as a dictator in our name. We would retain direct control of the Qingqiuese coast. More extreme ministers, however, believe that relying on Qingqiuans in any capacity is both dangerous and beneath our dignity, and demand total annexation of Qingqiu. The Imperial Army has expressed concerns about being able to effectively police the eastern frontier should direct rule be fully imposed, but the final decision lies with the Tenno.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC3.T;A Crisis in Arcadia;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC3.D;Lately, we have been deluged by complaints from government officials in the former Qingqiu. The exact nature of these complaints varies  insufficient resources, poor communication, rudimentary infrastructure, and an unruly local populace  but the conclusion is that we simply cannot efficiently administer the Qingqiuan interior. The work required to fix these problems could take decades but we are already running out of time. The tone of these complaints has become fearful and alarmed, and the situation in the Arcadian frontier has become critical. Entire towns have ceased reporting in, military outposts have come under attack from well-organized Qingqiuan militias, and patrols that head too far into the Mingxing Mountains have not returned. §RMany ministers believe that the creation of Dayan is the only way to prevent a total collapse of law and order.§;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC4.D;The worst fears of the Imperial Japanese Army have been realized : Qingqiu has burst into open rebellion. Ex-Qingqiuan general Hong Shikai has emerged from hiding in the Mingxing Mountains and declared the Second Qingqiuan Federal Republic with himself as its provisional president. This announcement triggered a cascade of uprisings across the frontier, which have totally overwhelmed our administration. Region after region has been seized, either by Shikais militias, or by insurrectionary bands of farmers and miners who have pledged varying degrees of loyalty to Shikai. Our garrisons have had to fall back to the western coast as a tsunami of resurgent Qingqiuan nationalism threatens to sweep us back into the Pacific. We are preparing a response to this calamity, but such preparations take time, and meanwhile, Shikai is making his own preparations;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC5.D;Japans aspirations to conquer all of Qingqiu without compromise has allowed a Qingqiuan insurgency to morph into a full-fledged revolution. General Hong Shikai leads an insurrectionary army towards Sanbao, seeking to drive Japan out of the coast and reclaim Qingqius lost lands. If Japan were to be defeated at this juncture, the whole Empire could be placed in jeopardy. The stage is set for what may either be Qingqius resurrection or its funeral dirge. Western Arcadia burns with the fires of war once again as Shikai marches to the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As we bury our dead and resume our administration of the frontier, we are once again confronted with the question of administration. Many believe that this rebellion is proof that the creation of Dayan is necessary for stability. Some go so far as to argue that we should further decentralize by creating a colonial dominion in Hokkaigan as well. Of course, the hardliners argue once again that only Japan can be trusted to rule these places, and it must be said that the insurgency and subsequent revolt have not inspired confidence in the trustworthiness of the Qingqiuans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC7.D;Though both Japan and Qingqiu have struggled mightily to claim victory, neither side has been able to gain a decisive advantage over the other. With no other option, the Tenno has consented to the signing of an armistice with the rebel leader, General Hong Shikai. Shikai shall administer the frontier as an independent Qingqiu, while the western coast shall remain in Japans possession. As many Qingqiuans depart to seek shelter in Shikais resurrected nation, the Tenno leaves Arcadia behind and turns his minds to other, hopefully more fruitful pursuits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC8.D;To the astonishment of all, Qingqiu has destroyed the Japanese invaders! Just when all hope seemed lost, General Hong Shikai arose from his stronghold in Mingxingshan to liberate the Qingqiuan people. Now the armies of the so-called Emperor of Japan have been thoroughly cleansed from the nation, and their feeble colonial administration has crumbled. Shikai has entered Sanbao, the streets thronged by thousands upon thousands of cheering citizens even as certain neighborhoods still smolder from the fighting. Much work must be done to heal the nation from this unprecedented ordeal, but all children of Zhongguo may rest easy tonight knowing that Qingqiu has once again defeated Japans mad aspirations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JPC9.D;Japanese natural scientists have taken quite an interest in the Galapagos Islands lately, making all sorts of geographical surveys of the area. This has begun to unnerve our navy, which suspects that these scientific missions are a pretext for more sinister purposes. A naval patrol was heading to the Galapagos to set up an outpost there when word was received of a sinking Japanese ship. It appears that the SS Yamasa, a merchant vessel bound for Tawantinsuyu, suffered a mysterious explosion near the islands. While much of the crew was able to evacuate and take shelter on the islands until they could be rescued, the Japanese press has seized upon the event with jingoistic fury. Declaring that our nation sunk the Yamasa with a mine, war-minded men across Japan are calling for nothing less than the Japanese conquest of the Galapagos Islands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Andagoyan canal project was seen as a dire threat to the Quechua economy, but now the ships of the world shall continue to visit the ports of Tawantinsuyu on their journeys around Ameriga. While Arcadians are enraged at this unilateral action by Japan to strangle their commerce, the merchants of Tawantinsuyu raise a glass to Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC131.A;though Andagoya would be better off under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Issues Andagoyan Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.D;Our presence in Andagoya has infuriated many countries across Arcadia and Europe, and $FROMCOUNTRY_GET_NAME$ in particular. They have denounced our actions as unilateralism of the knife and the gun, and the international equivalent of a bandits toll. Now, they have moved beyond libel and slander and graduated to serious threats. Their diplomatic representative has presented an ultimatum, approved by the highest levels of their government, demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Japanese government and military assets from Andagoya, the exile of Mallarino, and the establishment of a free Andagoyan government. Given their prior rhetoric, this is a ludicrous hypocrisy, but the specter of war with their nation is one which merits serious consideration. Some more pessimistic observers have gone so far as to deem Andagoya indefensible.";;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.A;Prepare a white kimono for our foreign minister...;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC14.B;The only thing indefensible is their cowardly bluster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC15.T;Andagoya is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC15.D;The Japanese resisted our demand vigorously, but in the end they proved to be a paper tiger. Their forces have disappeared from Andagoya, and Mallarino, the puppet leader whom they installed to rule Andagoya, has fled into exile to escape the wrath of the people that he sought to lord over. A new Andagoyan government has been formed, shaped by the greatest legal minds of our nation. With a sympathetic regime established and the exit of the Japanese occupation forces from the Isthmus of Andagoya, now might be an ideal time to capitalize on our success by building that canal which the Japanese spent so much time and effort trying to prevent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC15.A;Alls well that ends well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC16.T;The $COUNTRY$-Japanese War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC16.D;Japan has categorically refused any attempts to even discuss the matter of their occupation of Andagoya or the moratorium on canal construction. They have stated that it is a matter of national security and economic survival, and reiterate that the possible damage a canal might cause locally and to the Amerigan and the Pacific economies is too great a risk to take. The public has already been fanned into a fury with lurid reports of Japanese abuses towards the Andagoyans, so now, there is no turning back : the $COUNTRY$-Japanese War has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC16.A;Andagoya shall be free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC17.T;Andagoya is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC17.D;The Japanese occupation of Andagoya has finally been defeated! The last remnants of their forces have withdrawn from Andagoya, and Mallarino, the puppet leader whom the Japanese installed, was caught while trying to flee to Tawantinsuyu disguised as a peddler. A new Andagoyan government has been formed, shaped by the greatest legal minds of our nation. Its first order of business was to place Mallarino on trial for treason - he was convicted, and subsequently executed by firing squad. With a sympathetic regime established and the exit of the Japanese occupation forces from the Isthmus of Andagoya, now might be an ideal time to capitalize on our success by building that canal which the Japanese spent so much time and effort trying to prevent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC17.A;And so another obstacle crumbles before the march of progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC18.T;The End of the Andagoya Canal Moratorium;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC18.D;When Japan seized Andagoya and banned the construction of a canal across the isthmus, the world reacted with varying degrees of shock. European and Arcadian merchants were outraged, while Amerigans seemed rather pleased. However, it was $FROMCOUNTRY$ which reacted most severely : they issued an ultimatum to Japan to withdraw from Andagoya, and, after prevailed in the crisis, have asserted diplomatic hegemony over the region. As the Japanese Imperial Court reels from this catastrophic loss of face, it seems inevitable that $FROMCOUNTRY$ shall soon commence construction of the canal which Japan expended so much blood and treasure striving to prevent from being built.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC18.A;Yet another chapter in the history of Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC19.T;Japan Offers to Buy Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC19.D;Japans interest in the island of Formosa is well known. Positioned close to the Japanese Home Islands, its possession has long been held as a requirement by nearly all Japanese expansionists and foreign policy advocates. Japan has now come forward with a request to purchase the island from us. They are offering a sizable sum, but the colonys strategic position cannot be ignored, and its acquisition will not only strengthen Japan but also embolden it to embark on further expansionist projects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC19.A;Make the sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC19.B;Formosa is not for sale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.T;Japan Offers to Buy Brunei;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.D;As Japan continues to build its colonial empire, our holding in Brunei has come to their attention. They seek a port in the East Indies, and have thus come forward with an offer to buy the whole Brunei colony. While our nation has sadly seen its own international presence decline, we might be able to use this opportunity to free ourselves of an unprofitable colony and infuse some money into our coffers. On the other hand, this will inevitably strengthen Japan and may open the door for further Japanese expansion into the East Indies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.A;We need the money, do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC20.B;Brunei is not for sale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC21.T;Spain Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC21.D;Our efforts to purchase Spains Brunei colony were successful. The territory has now come under our control and our position in the East Indies has been strengthened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC21.A;And the Rising Sun illuminates yet more of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC22.T;Spain Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC22.D;Our efforts to purchase Spains Brunei colony were unsuccessful. Spain has declared that the only way they shall be parted from Brunei is by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC22.A;Banzai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC23.T;Rusun is Ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC23.D;At last, the northernmost part of the land the Europeans call the Christianer Archipelago has come under our control! Though this marks yet another victory for Japan, it seems that the political attention of our nation is already drifting to other places. Rusun may not command the same level of focus as it recently has, but it shall still remain an important part of our colonial empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC23.A;Im going there on holiday next week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC24.T;Japan Demands the Maniolas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC24.D;For years, Asian experts in our nation have watched the steady expansion of Japans colonial empire in Asia with growing alarm. Alas, it appears that their vigilance was warranted, for Japan has now seen fit to place our territories in the Christianer Islands in their sights. An ultimatum has been delivered to our government by Japan, demanding nothing less than the full and immediate cession of the Maniolas under threat of war. The close proximity of the colonies to Japan would make them quite difficult to defend, but can our nation really afford such a monumental humiliation as to cede the whole area without a fight? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC24.A;We dont have a choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
JPC24.B;To Hell with Japan, Scandinavia is not dead yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC25.T;The Nordic-Japanese War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC25.D;Scandinavia has flatly refused to surrender so much as a single Christianer Island to us! Diplomacy having failed, war is now inevitable. The whole world watches with bated breath as Japan squares off against a true European power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC25.A;We shall crush them easily!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC26.T;Japanese Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC26.D;Many deemed it impossible. Many dismissed the notion that a people as primitive, backwards, or inferior as the Japanese could ever challenge Scandinavian might. Today, many people have been proven wrong. Japan has bested us at every turn, and we have been forced to cave in to their demands. All of our holdings in the Christianer Islands are now forfeit. This is a dark day for Scandinavia : we have been defeated not simply by a foreign power, but by an Asian one at that. This shame shall not fade quickly;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC26.A;Scandinavias future grows ever dimmer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC260.T;Scandinavian Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC260.D;The worst fears of our nation, of our people, have been proven correct. Scandinavia, for all the rumors of their feebleness, has triumphed. They have bested us at every turn, and we have been forced to cave in to their demands. All of our claims to the Christianer Islands are now forfeit. This is a dark day for Japan : we have been defeated not simply by a foreign power, but by a European one at that. This shame shall not fade quickly;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC260.A;Have we angered the kami?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC27.T;Formation of the Kyowakai Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC27.D;The Kyowakai, or Concordia, Society has been formed in Japan. Despite its innocuous-sounding name, the group exists to advance Japans imperialist interests against China in the name of social progress and economic development. With a growing array of lobbyists, sympathetic media outlets, agents provocateur, and wealthy supporters, the Kyowakai Society will stop at nothing to drive the spear of Japanese imperialism into the bosom of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC27.A;Yet more suffering on the horizon for the Middle Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC28.T;The Kyowakai Society Targets Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC28.D;The Kyowakai Society has turned their propaganda machine towards us, seeking to push Japan into conflict to penetrate our markets. They slander us in their newspapers, libel us with their politicians, and infiltrate us with their agents. Matters came to a head recently, as a diplomatic incident occurred when a group of Japanese merchants connected to Kyowakai were caught up in a local criminal investigation in one of our port cities. The merchants allege that they were abused, mistreated, and defrauded by our barbaric and savage mockery of a legal code, and the Kyowakai Society has seized upon the incident as demonstrating the need for Japan to intervene in our affairs and defend the honor of the merchants. Suffice to say, war is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC28.A;This is nothing but naked greed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC29.T;The Kyowakai Society Targets Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC29.D;The Kyowakai Society has turned their propaganda machine towards us, seeking to push Japan into conflict to penetrate our markets. They slander us in their newspapers, libel us with their politicians, and infiltrate us with their agents. Matters came to a head recently, as a diplomatic incident occurred when a group of Japanese merchants connected to Kyowakai were caught up in a local criminal investigation in one of our concession cities. The merchants allege that they were abused, mistreated, and defrauded by our barbaric and savage mockery of a legal code, and the Kyowakai Society has seized upon the incident as demonstrating the need for Japan to assume control of the port and defend the honor of the merchants. Suffice to say, war is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC29.A;THEY are calling US barbaric!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.T;The Nagoya Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.D;The continued competition for influence in China leaves the Great Powers in a situation of perpetual struggle, always stepping on one anothers toes within the East Asian market. Seeking to end the cycle of confrontation, the Japanese Republic has called a conference in the city of Nagoya to discuss the situation of Chinese trade, and the role of the Great Powers within it. At least, thats what they claimed that it would be about. However, over the course of the conference, it became clear to all attendees that Japan was seeking nothing less than international ratification of its role as exclusive guarantor, protector, and regulator of Chinese trade! While Japan has promised to be impartial, courteous, honorable, and just in its duties as enlightened guide of Chinese trade, the implications of such international sanctioning would be nothing less than approval to monopolize Chinas maritime trade and the surrender of our influence in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.A;We trust the Japanese, approve the measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC30.B;This is preposterous! Recall our diplomats at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC31.T;The Nagoya Conference Succeeds;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC31.D;To the astonishment of even our most optimistic ministers, the Nagoya Conference has ended splendidly! Japans role as guardian of Chinese trade has been approved by the consent of all other Great Powers involved in the region. A new era of peace and prosperity in East Asia begins as the Japanese Republic assumes the natural role of impartial arbiter of Chinese commerce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC31.A;Welltheoretically impartial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC32.T;Failure of the Nagoya Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC32.D;Although the Great Powers had hoped to come to an agreement on Chinese trade, they proved unreceptive to the notion of Japan taking control of it. So unreceptive, in fact, that as soon as they understood this to be our goal, they withdrew from the conference immediately. As foreign diplomats from around the world rapidly depart from Nagoya, our government is left with few options. We know that we are the only ones who can be trusted to safeguard Chinese trade, but it seems that the rest of the world remains ignorant. They seem to be unaware that our main goal is peace in East Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC32.A;Well, then, the world must learn of our peaceful waysBY FORCE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC33.T;Japan Announces the Sangoku Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC33.D;Sangoku, or Three Countries, is a phrase which has been used to describe the region of Asia before the notion was introduced by European geographers. In its original usage, it refers to Honshu (the largest island of Japan), Kara (China), and Tenjiku (India). Lately, however, it has become a byword among Japanese political scientists for pan-Asian solidarity against European imperialism in Asia. The Japanese Republic has now adopted Sangoku as its official policy. Academic distinctions aside, the direct consequences of this is nothing less than Japan declaring open hostility to all regimes holding colonies in Asia. Anybody could now become a target for Japans wrath in the name of pan-Asianism...;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC33.A;Why do all republics succumb to bloodlust?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.T;Sangoku;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.D;Japan, China, and India : the Sangoku, the three pillars of Asian civilization, all part of one common home. Yet the Western powers wage war upon the Sangoku, upon not only the peoples of Asia but against human beauty and cultural community. We must resist them! The time has come for us to strike back against the foreigners and to defend the peoples of Asia in the name of solidarity. Our military has identified one country in particular whose colonies may be ready for liberation. However, we might find it more prudent to bide our time before striking. Of course, there are always those who argue that a militant interpretation of Sangoku is hypocritical and that the best way to pursue it would be through diplomatic and economic pressure instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.A;Pan-Asianism demands that we take action!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.B;We must make further preparations first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC34.C;The time has come to adopt a new approach to Sangoku.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.T;An Alliance with Japan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.D;While Japan lies in the northern Pacific, far from our home in the south, they have been seeking to expand their diplomatic influence throughout the region. As a result, Japanese diplomats have come forward and proposed a military alliance between our nations. They argue that Zhourao and Japan have further enough fields of interest that we would not conflict with one another, that we are both Asian peoples and thus opposed to European imperialism, and that we would both benefit from having a partner on the other end of the Pacific. The idea is tempting, but we should be wary of being drawn int Japans foreign adventures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.A;The Japanese shall surely be trustworthy allies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC35.B;Let us remain merely good neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.T;The Pact of Kagoshima;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.D;Our diplomatic delegation to Japan has been unexpectedly drawn into a series of high-level meetings with the Japanese government in the city of Kagoshima. It seems that the Japanese are seeking an alliance with Zhourao  and they are willing to help us unify the continent. Currently, the western region of Zuharra is occupied by a third party, a foreign power whom Zhourao might not be able to beat on our own. Japans help would be a tremendous advantage, but we should be mindful of Japans motives. Placing ourselves so totally in their confidence could allow them to gain vast sway over our politics and our economy and might even jeopardize our sovereignty in the future. Yet still, Zuharra beckons, and this might be an excellent chance to liberate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.A;Together we march to Zuharra!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC36.B;We will unify the continent by ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC37.T;The Zuharran War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC37.D;It was somewhat expected that Zhourao would one day strike against our colony on the western side of the continent, seeing as how they have traditionally claimed the region even if they could not enforce said claim. There has, however, been an unexpected development : Japan and Zhourao have formed an alliance for the purpose of driving us out of the continent and bringing Zuharra under Zhouraos control! There is no time to negotiate, Zhourao scouts have already been sighted along the coast and the Japanese fleet has been spotted heading south towards the continent. If we want to keep Zuharra then we shall have to fight to defend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC37.A;All of this trouble for ZUHARRA, of all places?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.T;A Japanese Sunrise over Zhourao;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.D;Theres a popular European saying : If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is too good to be true. Unfortunately, it appears that Japans agreement to help us liberate Zuharra fits that bill. A group of pro-Japanese military officers, backed by treasonous politicians and businessmen, have been circulating propaganda accusing the current regime of weakness and immorality, while praising Japans rapid economic and political advancement. They have now put their Japanophilia into practice, marching on the capital and seeking to install a pro-Japan regime! If successful, they will likely sign over vast amounts of Zhouraos political and economic sovereignty to Japan, reducing us to a puppet state. However, rumors are swirling that Japan has already dispatched reinforcements to bolster the coup. Even if we defeat the insurrection, Japan may take matters into their own hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.A;The coup is successful, and Zhourao embraces the Rising Sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC38.B;The coup is defeated, but Japan is coming;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC39.T;The Japanese-Zhourao War;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC39.D;Since the inauguration of Japans infamously belligerent Emperor, much of Asia has come under the withering gaze of their imperial greed. Up until now, we thought that we were far enough removed from Japan that they would not seriously trouble us. To put it bluntly, we were mistaken. Japans mad emperor has declared his intention to conquer all of Zhourao, and a Japanese invasion force is already heading straight for us! Zhourao, forged in the fires of adversity, now faces its greatest battle yet. The Emperor is coming south;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
JPC39.A;and its fight, work, or perish for Zhourao.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

True, much of that work was done by our police and military rooting out Lotharian and Odonian nationalists, but that doesn't matter right now. What matters is that today, across Odonia, countless loyal subjects wake up each morning and thank Almighty God for delivering them into Beornias benevolent hands. Let us estrange these wondrous kinsmen from the fullness of our embrace no longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

atlantian_ruhr_desc; The Atlantian mining industry has been world-famous for centuries, but only now is its true potential being realized. As new veins of metals, precious or otherwise, are being discovered seemingly every day, the mines are being enlarged and energized by new technologies and industrial tactics. The influx of immigrants keeps labor cheap and plentiful, and the profitability of the mines has corporations flocking to Atlantia. German technicians have deemed this emerging situation the 'Atlantian Ruhr,' but they are naïve, for we shall surpass all the mines of Europe and perhaps the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

claim_the_chacco_desc;The Chaco Plain is a vast semiarid region in central Ameriga, home to a variety of flora and fauna, as well as a host of native tribes. So far, it has existed in relative isolation, lying beyond the frontiers of any Amerigan nation. However, our explorers have reported that the land would be quite suitable for logging, farming, and ranching, in various locations, and could probably support a substantial population with sufficient infrastructure. As competition grows amongst Amerigan states to secure the continents territories, we should act quickly to claim the Chaco for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LOT1.T;Federation of Amazonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT1.D;The Amazonian Federation declared independence in 1825 among the chaotic events in Europe and Colombia and has maintained relative stability even if there has been friction with Equinoxia and its refusal to compromise with Slave Holders. However, its first action of foreign policy was to seize the region of Atlantia during the Lotharigia Civil War. A action which has not been recognized by anyone in Ameriga and was considered nothing more then a deliberately aggressive act to cement its hold on the continent. If Lotharingia were to stabilize, there may be a final war to decide the fate of Atlantia in the Amazonian Federation and it may be likely that we will fail to keep it. However, if we did win this war then the region would be recognized as our own and Lotharigia will likely be unable to rise against us ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

LOT2.T;Oriental Republic of Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT2.D;Once a colony of the Kingdom of Burgundy, Lotharingia is well recognized as one of the first post-colonial Amerigan nations (with the exception of the Kingdom of Beronia). However, the fact that a large portion of the wealthy population still believed in European monarchist ideas would ultimately doom this young nation into a civil war. The "Loyalist Government" would ultimately prevail in this civil war but Atlantia would be lost to Amazonia and it would have no intent to rejoin a dictatorial government. Some members of the Lotharian Congress are already considering making a compromise with the remaining monarchists and land owners that would allow for democratic rule once again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL1.T;The Golden Board of Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL1.D;Atlantia was once only a borderland between the Anglois and Burgundian colonies in Ameriga. But it all changed when gold was found in the mountains. Atlantia soon became the most prized land in the continent and was taken and lost during several wars while the influx of gold mined by immigrants from all over Europe upsetted the global economy. Thus in 1771 was established the Golden Board, a tripartite commission headed by a Spanish representative to ensure neutrality. The fate of Atlantia was to be negotiated 50 years later but thanks to the instability in the new nation of Lotharingia and the troubles in the still Anglois colony of Equinoxia, Spain was able to renew the mandate for 20 years. Lotharians and Amazonians have however demanded to access the board, a claim refuted by both their former overlords and now both have claimed Atlantia part of their nations. On the other hand, Atlantians clamor for independence from Europe, and as gold mines deplete, the Spanish become more amenable to these demands. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL3.D;"Port Sucre shines across it's blue pearled sea. A Jewel of it's French Heritage, it's people, both white & black go about their day with the encouragement of only their discipline. Each street as cleaned as it's buildings, on account of the Planteur's charitable nature of loaning a team of domestic servants each week to the streets of the city. For the Planteur, they are well-dressed, assorted of European wears and passionate of their connection with 'La Patrie' , the care they place into their homes & people is astounding. The Equinoxian, as the Westerners call themselves, care more for their love of the church, and their paternalist thoughts for the natives, and naught to care for their appearance on a daily basis. This land is split between the modern man, and the colonial...

ATL4.D;"Passing the Grande Riviere on our boat, and a few fair hours of awaiting, we come across the Great city of Fort Lothere, it's namesake was certainly no joke, for the passing of great stone keeps laid across the Lagoon, awaiting, and a watching any and all strangers who come and go.The City is unlike the great ranching homesteads I had heard of, it's people are fairly dressed, god fearing amongst them, the riches of Atlantia never passed here, and yet the Silver of the Inca's had laid their mark bare in the realms of the smartly assorted streets of estates made for government men. Now, it's people retain their spirited mind, they wear what little wealth they afford with pride, and loyalties too, with many wearing the De Aigle Blue shoulder ware, or even the 'Beornian' red, as these Amerigans call it.

Even as I sailed up to the city, the stench of rotting meat was already hitting my very senses before the Docks were even within calling distance. Even afar the city warned me of it's very, red-blooded nature with the waving of red cloth amongst all corners of it's shores. The people were almost asymptomatic to the very disgusting fabric of their 'capital'. They lacked any wealth upon their character, and yet they wandered with the smiles of the most indignant and ignorant babes to their world of deserted wealth . And even for their city-livers, they spat and shushed amongst the 'Barons' of the interior, who wore their poverty cloaks of red with pride, like they were the finest Venetian jewellery, and acted like the most prestigious of men in the Estates.

The people of this city are inclined to the mandate moreso to any colonial loyalty. No amazonian or lotharingian exists here, just the atlantians, public debates are common with the students attendance, and yet they are as civilised in discourse as the cities aesthetic.

ATL7.D;Gustave Jean Rochefort, a prominent intellectual and historian of Nouvelle-Amsterdam finally published his magnum opus which has received the praise of all Atlantian elites. His work focuses on the creation of the Atlantian people as a result of the Treaty of Paris of 1771, with liberty brought by the new international mandate. The cities of Victoire and Nouvelle Amsterdam began to attract new faces to their shores after the initial influx of slaves and workers : artists, who had come to paint or draw the gold-lined estates, Noble sons, with no stake to their fathers inheritance. Writers and educated men, who had wished to enlighten themselves to a new territory of land and knowledge they had not found in their homeland. In just a fair few generations, Nouvelle Amsterdam's streets became as enlightened a place as Anvers or Prague. From this situation was born a new people, who follow first the principle of the liberty of their nation, and all of it's inhabitants to choose as they like;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL8.T;The gold mines tarnished;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL8.D;The Gold Mines of Atlantia, a large part of our economy ever since the beginning of the Gold rush that has been ongoing for nearly 70 years, has finally ended. The gold mines have run out, and no new mines have come to replace the old. This will of course have an effect on our economy, however, many also believ this signals an end to Spanish company rule, as the Golden Board exists to only manage gold extraction in Atlantia and perhaps, as hoped by Nationalists, the start of a truly independent Atlantia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL8.A;It was good while it lasted;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL10.T;End of the Atlantian gold rush;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL10.D;The Governor of the Atlantian Golden Board has confirmed what many have been predicting for years: Atlantia has finally run out of gold! This of course puts the political order in Atlantia into question, as for around 70 years now the mandate of the Golden board was, naturally, the gold that was found in Atlantia. Now that this is no longer the case, we will undoubtedly be forced to give up our oversight there;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL11.T;The Atlantian referendum ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL11.D;The day has finally come : the Governor of the Golden Board on behalf of the Triple power agreement has organized a vote on the status of Atlantia. The debates lies in two things : first, whether or not Atlantia shall continue to exist but this time as an independent Republic. The second question if independence is not chosen, which country shall Atlantia choose ? Most of the Atlantians have more in common with Lotharingia since the place was originally a Burgundian colony, but the Dictatorship of De Aigle make the Republic of Amazonia a plausible candidate for the citizens to join. Now the ballots are counted and  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL13.T;The Atlantian independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL13.D;The Results for the Atlantian referendum are in, and they have supposedly voted for Independence. This is a doubtless loss for our nation, as Atlantians are undoubtedly Amazonian in origin, and would be serverd well by our rule. We now have to either accept the results, which would maintain stability in our region and help soothe relations between us and Lotharingia. However, we could declare the results forgeries, and press our rightful claim on Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL14.T;The Atlantian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL14.D;Atlantia has voted, in a referendum, to declare themselves independent. We were hoping the Atlantians would realise their true nature as a Lotharingian people, however it seems Atlantians and Lotharingians did not see eye to eye. We now have a choice: Either we back down and recognise Atlantian independence, as shameful as that would be, or we declare the results a forgery (Which, according to most of our government, it must be) and press our rightful claim on the area;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL15.D;Following the referendum to end the Golden Mandate of Spain, Burgundy and the Dual-Monarchy over Atlantia, its inhabitants voted to establish a new Republic in the New-World. Many were fearful that either Amazonia or Lotharingia which had staked claims over their territory would contest the results of the vote but thankfully both accepted the results and recognized the new Republic.

While accepted by Amazonia, this result was seen as a maneuver of the European imperialists and President De Aigle has decided to invade the Republic to reunify the Atlantians with their Lotharian brothers.

But even then, it is assuring to know other see our point of view. Atlantia itself is a rich prize, but the Gold is long gone at this point, although we will of course integrate the land into our nation despite this. Amazonia will not be satisfied with this state of affairs, and many fear we may need to prove our claim on the battlefield, but for now we have won;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

To outsiders, it is merely a club gathering the elites of Atlantia, but few know the truth about the power that lies within. Home of the Amerigan Society, a masonic-like society that emerged in Atlantia following the establishment of the Mandate, whose members are devoted to their goal of a unified Ameriga based upon liberal principles. Independence was largely gained through their actions, and it was merely the first step of their plan towards the creation of a united Amerigan state. §BAlready, plans are formulated to carve up Amazonia and Lotharingia, to reform their failed constitutions and political systems.§!  §RBy force, if needed.§ ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL23.D;The rich region of Atlantia has ended up in our hands following the referendum and the war. Eventually we have assumed control over the jewel of Ameriga, and already businessmen from Victoire and Nouvelle-Amsterdam have entered our national market. Their influence is important and many in the planteur elites of Antarctica fear that the precarious balance of the nation will be upset by these new interest groups. Atlantians prize Liberty above all, and they are already reaching for the Equinoxians who share much of the same ideals, and criticize the venerable institution of slavery that has allowed us to build a rich and stable nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL23.A;A poisoned gift ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL24.T;The Society of the Friends of the Blacks;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL24.D;One major club of Atlantia is the Society of the Friends of the Blacks, a philanthropic organization whose aim is the abolition of slavery in Ameriga and the Atlantic at large. It was created in 1804 by the philosopher and journalist Jean-Marie Mercier who dedicated his fortune to the abolitionist cause. The society managed to lobby their Spanish overlord to forbid slave trade in the Golden Mandate, and fought for many years for eventual abolition in Atlantia proper but to no avail because of the use of the African slaves in the gold mines. But as gold mining declined, many former Liberal bourgeois have begun to join the society which publishes the main newspaper of the region : le Libéral. The importance of this journal is felt throughout the whole country as they publish articles upon articles dealing with the open wound of slavery and many Planteurs in the North-East have taken actions to forbid its publishing. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL24.A;Can't they talk about something less controversial ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL25.T;Frédéric Delgrès in Atlantia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL25.D;Frédéric Delgrès is one of the most prominent and divisive orators of the country. Born a slave to a Black man and a Tupi woman, he served as a secretary for his masters wife whom had remarked his intellectual capacities and taught him to read. After years of bondage, he managed to escape and continued his education in the free state of Equinoxia. There, he was threatened by his former master who invoked the anti-fugitive laws. Following a lengthy trial, Delgrès was able to buy his liberty thanks to the patronage of the Atlantian Friends. Since then, he has become the main orator of the Abolitionist cause in Amazonia, despite several attempts on his life by the Planteurs. Following the inclusion of Atlantia in the Federation, he toured the place, welcomed in every city by roaring crowds, and meeting several influential individuals in Nouvelle-Amsterdam. His speech in the City Hall has already been published throughout the country and also in Lotharingia by the Libéral papers and is recognized as one of his best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL25.A;A really amazing character!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.T;A Meeting in Port Sucre;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.D;Port-Sucre is the capital of the first Antarctican settlements in the North-East and the land has used slave labor since the XVIth century in sugar plantations. Thats where the power of the planter class is the strongest, and where the abolitionist ideals are throwned upon by even the lower classes of white society. Nonetheless, François Barnave, an influential Senator and planteur, often qualified the true power in Antarctica, received a delegation coming straight from Atlantia. The informal meeting discussed the current political crisis related to slavery in the nation. Atlantians understood the economical consequences of abolition and thus pushed forward a plan where a freedom of womb law wiuld allow the gradual abolition while still benefiting the planteurs which would have a lifetime to plan for a society freed of slavery. But the delegation warned : the plan was already criticized in Equinoxia as it was, and should it not pass in the Assembly, the Atlantian Liberals would use every means at their disposal to fight planters power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.A;A compromise is reached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL26.B;This is Amazonia, not Atlantia, they don't dictate laws here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL27.T;The Freedom of Womb Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL27.D;Debate has been fierce in Amazonia following independence as the planters from Antarctica had to face harsh criticism from the Equinoxians who had abolished it during their fight for independence. A weird status quo had emerged with the country divided between the free West and the slave-holding East. The integration of Atlantia only furthered the divide and tensions had been steadily rising over the years. But eventually the planters from Antarctica were swayed by the new Atlantian politicians who managed to convince them to pursue gradual abolition by letting pass a freedom of womb law. While abolitionnists are discontent everyone recognizes a small step has been taken. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL27.A;A bright future for Amazonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL28.T;The Failure of the Abolition Bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL28.D;Debate has been fierce in Amazonia following independence as the planters from Antarctica had to face harsh criticism from the Equinoxians who had abolished it during their fight for independence. A weird status quo had emerged with the country divided between the free West and the slave-holding East. The integration of Atlantia only furthered the divide and tensions had been steadily rising over the years. At first, it seemed that hope was in sight, as a bill to gradually abolish slavery finally made its way onto the floor of the Amazonian legislature. Liberals across Amazonia were crestfallen and horrified, however, when it was announced that the bill had failed to pass. It appears that the power and influence of the Planteurs was simply too immense for even the most spirited anti-slavery activism to overcome it. As slaveowners raise a toast to their continued domination of the country, the Abolitionnistes begin to plan their next moves, which shall, given the failure of a democratic solution, surely be extreme indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL28.A;Don't worry about that rabble, my friend! More wine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL29.T;The Gouas Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL29.D;Although the Planteurs were wary of the seeming surge in liberal activity in the aftermath of the Abolition Bills failure, none but the most paranoid of them had expected this latest turn of events. A coalition of liberals, many of them Atlantians, have congregated in Gouas, a region with growing amounts of abolitionist sentiments, and issued a proclamation which affirms their absolute and unequivocal opposition to slavery and its supporters. However, the document then goes on to declare that, as the Amazonian government has proven neither able nor willing to uphold the natural rights of its people, the liberals have declared the Amazonian regime of bondage and torture illegitimate and have raised the flag of rebellion! Rallying under a reborn Equinoxia, they seek nothing less than the overthrow of Amazonia and the installation of an abolitionist regime. Officers and regional governors are choosing sides, and war is on the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

ATL30.T;The Amazonian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL30.D;The battle lines have been drawn across what was once one Amazonia, and military officers and regional governors have chosen their sides. At stake is the fate of black Amazonians : will they finally achieve freedom or shall they remain clasped in bondage? Thought Atlantia has sought to sway the country towards liberalism, the slaveowners retain entrenched power in the east, and shall resist with all their might any attempts to end Amazonian slavery. Eastern Ameriga plunges once more into the fire, as the Planteurs and Abolitionnistes clash in the war which shall determine the destiny of the nation and perhaps the continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL30.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL31.T;Planteur Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL31.D;Despite the passion of the Equinoxian traitors, and the Atlantian gold which filled their pockets, we have crushed their treasonous insurrection. Some abolitionists have already fled abroad, but many more shall face the prison cell, the gallows, or the firing squad. Black Amazonians find their aspirations obliterated as the Planteurs truly reign supreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL31.A;Back to work, boy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL32.T;Abolitionniste Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL32.D;At last, at long last, the regime of the Planteurs has been toppled! Though a few notable slaveowners have slipped away into exile, many more shall finally face justice for their crimes against their fellow man. Newly freed black Amazonians rejoice at this triumphant victory over the tyranny of slavery, a beacon of hope to those still enslaved throughout the world. And, of course, nobody can forget the role which the Atlantians played in securing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
ATL32.A;Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL33.T;End of the Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL33.D;Despite their fierce commitments to their ideals, neither Amazonia nor Equinoxia were able to gain a decisive advantage over the other. After a bitter peace of status quo was hammered out between the two nations, the Abolitionniste coalition has splintered. Gouas, a mercurial ally at best, saw no reason for further cooperation, and has declared independence. Not only have the Abolitionnistes seemingly accepted this fait accompli, but the sense of dispirit has spread. The Atlantians, having lost faith in Equinoxian leadership, have followed Gouas in declaring independence, hoping to achieve their goals without having to work within another power. The greater Equinoxia which the Abolitionnistes erected lies shattered, reduced to its core territories as the coalition falls into infighting. Though Amazonia is much reduced, perhaps the Planteurs have had the last laugh after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

The Argentins of Gouas, a Planteur bastion, are loathed by other parts of the nation for their notoriously flamboyant and autocratic governor, who has turned much of the region into his fief. Meanwhile, the liberal Equinoxians challenge the slaveocracy and champion the ideals forged in the fires of the Great German Wars and the revolutions which preceded them. While the government has previously been able to prevent discord amongst its provinces, the situation seems to now be growing serious. As the regional differences of Amazonia continue to cause political flareups, some whisper of violence, of secession, of civil war;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL34.A;Why are they getting so troublesome all of a sudden?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL35.T;Helping Amazonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL35.D;The Amazonian Federation seems to be entering a period of unrest. Gouas and Equinoxia are both beginning to challenge the governments authority, albeit for vastly different reasons, putting strain on the federal balance of power. This situation presents an excellent opportunity to break the Planteur slaveowners stranglehold on the country, using our influence among the various politicians and groups of Amazonia. We may watch safely from a distance as the old order comes crashing down, and if we are successful, a better society, one of equity, equality, and justice, shall replace it. The simplest method of doing this would be to help discontented areas of Amazonia push for greater autonomy  the more autonomy the better. Let us convene a meeting in Victoire to broach the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL35.A;We are here to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.T;The Victoire Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.D;The situation in Gouas and Equinoxia is reaching a breaking point. Both states have begun to resist efforts by the federal government to rein them in or even to collect taxes in their states, the former because of its well-connected and despotic governor and the latter because of its liberal opposition to slavery. Reports that they have begun organizing independent militias, however, has caused sufficient alarm as to compel moderates to seek a negotiated solution. Into this crisis has stepped Atlantia, who has convened a meeting in Victoire to discuss the issue. What they have proposed shocked our representatives : the granting of high levels of autonomy to Gouas and Equinoxia, effectively making them internally sovereign states, though we would control their foreign affairs. Many Planteurs are outraged at this plan but a few have admitted that it may be the only way to prevent this situation from spiraling into war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.A;If that is what is needed to preserve peace, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL36.B;Ridiculous! Leave the meeting at once, we won't stand for this insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL37.T;The Victoire Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL37.D;Our efforts to secure a diplomatic solution to the Amazonian federalist crisis were successful. Gouas and Equinoxia have now become nearly sovereign, but for the Amazonian overseers which remain to control their foreign affairs. Civil war has been prevented, but Amazonia is now considerably weaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL37.A;Peace in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL38.T;Failure of the Victoire Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL38.D;Our efforts to secure a diplomatic solution to the Amazonian federalist crisis were unsuccessful. The Amazonians were suspicious of us even before the meeting began, but when our representative explained the proposal for Antarctican and Equinoxian autonomy, the Amazonians flew into a rage. Denouncing us as a conclave of vultures and coyotes and a den of scavengers, they left the conference with haste, and the crestfallen Argentin and Equinoxian delegates soon followed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL38.A;Was it something that we said?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL39.T;The Conseil Seizes Power;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL39.D;The continued machinations of Atlantia, Equinoxia, and Gouas, coupled with the federal governments apparent inability to respond, has pushed the military into taking action. A cabal of generals and admirals, proclaiming themselves to be the defenders of the rule of law, have seized control of the government and persuaded the previous civilian authorities to appoint the conspirators to a military conseil to govern the nation instead. This news has been received particularly badly in Equinoxia, where phrases like ravishing of democracy and illegitimate takeover have been bandied about. Perhaps it is well that the military is in control, since now we shall probably have need of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL39.A;For order and stability!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL40.T;Rumblings From Equinoxia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL40.D;It is no secret that Equinoxia has been the center of dissent since the conseil took power, much to the aggravation of our righteous leaders. While we have always known of their tendency towards troublemaking, they are now embracing much more dangerous pursuits. It seems that earlier reports about Equinoxian militias were true, as several policemen have discovered evidence of them drilling in the countryside. Whats more, officers in Equinoxia have reported meetings of notable Equinoxians under cover of darkness, in basements or on farms  meetings where firebrands preach the doctrine of secession. The conseil has, understandably, not taken this well, and has ordered all such meetings broken up and anybody found to be attending them arrested. While our security personnel assure us that this will break the back of any anti-Amazonian conspiracies, no matter how many meetings we disrupt, they seem to be growing more frequent and numerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL40.A;Just keep it out of the papers, it'll all blow over soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL41.T;The Equinoxian Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL41.D;It seems that our raids on Equinoxian secessionist meetings and our attempts to track down the militias were for naught. This morning, a proclamation was issued signed by regional officials from across Equinoxia, denouncing the federal government as the clawed hand of slaveocracy and the bludgeon of the Planteurs, and repudiating their allegiance to the conseil. The Equinoxians, desiring an equal, equitable, and just government, which rules by the consent of the governed and allows all men, regardless of color, to give or retract that consent to their representatives, have dissolved all ties with the federal government. This document is nothing less than articles of secession! Already Equinoxian military officers have rapidly defected to this rebellion, which now stands poised to fight. The Amazonian Civil War has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL41.A;Crush the revolters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.T;The Gouas Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.D;Our spies in Amazonia have confirmed that tensions at their highest between the Antarcticans and the Equinoxians. At any moment, war could erupt between the two regions. While a tragedy, it also gives us an opportunity. The region of Gouas is rich in lands and possibilities of industry and slavery doesn't hold as much power as it does in the North of Antarctica. Moreover the governor of the place is a greedy man that is thankfully full of debts. We could arrange a small bribe to him to consider an 'independence fight', under our protection of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.A;Contact our men in Gouas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL42.B;We are better than this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.T;The Secession of Gouas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.D;As if the secession of Equinoxia wasnt bad enough, now Gouas has also declared independence! Their governor has spouted various platitudes on regional liberty and resisting federal tyranny, but we suspect a different motive to at play. While he has acted rather defiant in the past, he is known to have expensive tastes and vast debts  and, recently, to have been in contact with Atlantian businessmen. Our domestic spies have confirmed that Goaus has gotten very friendly with Atlantia recently, and all evidence points to this being nothing less than a plot to backstab us in our moment of weakness! We shall not forget this Atlantian intrigue, but how should we deal with the problem in the short term?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.A;We shall crush Gouas as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL43.B;We must focus on Equinoxia for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL44.T;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL44.D;The dust has settled upon Amazonia. Though thousands upon thousands of lives have been lost, today a new day dawns upon eastern Ameriga. The victors shall surely reshape the nation in their image, as the ideologies of the vanquished are cast into the ashes of history. Perhaps a new generation shall rise to advance them once more in the future, but for now, Amazonia and its fate are in our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL44.A;We shall steward it well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL45.T;Atlantia in the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL45.D;Despite the intrigues of Amazonia, the Atlantians have seen the light and integrated into our nation. However, while this shall surely be a tremendous boon for our economy, some speak with concern about the political ideas such a liberal city might introduce into our nation. Atlantia is known for radicalism, which is the last thing that a stable and secure republic like Lotharingia needs. Nevertheless, as our treasury begins to swell with the taxes and tariffs we reap from Atlantias mines and trade, few are in much position to worry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL45.A;I'm sure that it won't be a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL46.T;Plotters in Ariraboua;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL46.D;It seems that de Aigles fears towards Atlantia were not misplaced after all. His vast network of spies, informants, and other agents have already begun to bring word of liberal schemes emanating from Nouvelle Amsterdam. Rumors abound of plans by reformers and radical republicans to bring serious political change to Lotharingia and point to one place : the notorious Ariraboua club which most Atlantian politicians, journalists and officers frequent. de Aigle knows that this means that treason is afoot, and that the liberals are planning nothing less than his removal from power and the toppling of his regime. Perhaps they even seek to have him go the way of Caesar;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL46.A;Traitors! I'm surrounded by traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.T;Choice of the Chef;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.D;Over the years, the political actions of de Aigle have varied but for one thing : the independence and unity of Lotharingia. All his actions have always been in the interest of the new nation that was born out of the oppression of Burgundy. But as Atlantian interests take over a large part of the national economy and their Liberal views create instability, the 'chef' wonders. His Presidency-for-life of the Republic only arose because of the Civil War against the traitors that wanted to tie Lotharingia with Europe once again : they had used democracy to weaken the country after all. Over the years, in his discussions with Edward of Beornia he nonetheless expressed that ruling would be easier as King, and the idea of royalty has often been used both to support his actions or tarnish his reputation. But at the same time, with Lotharingia reunified with Atlantia and proved strong and resilient, perhaps it is time to let democracy flourish once again in the country and bring back the ideals of the Lotharian Founding Fathers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.A;A monarchy fits the national character!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.B;This has worked for years, why change it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL47.C;Call new elections, it is time to rebuild democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL48.T;The Free Elections of Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL48.D;Lotharingia has seen harsh times since its independence. de Aigle, le Libérateur had seized power following the election of the New-Alsatians party (named that way because most of its leaders came from the north of the country) and had cemented his rule for decades. But following the reunification of Atlantia with the rest of the country, Liberals had regained power and many feared a new Civil War was on its way. The announcement of new elections and the resignation of de Aigle was thus seen as a surprise to many. But as the new president Roger de Lisle, an Atlantian born politician, takes office, de Aigle has formally granted him his former function and welcomed him with a speech that was widely distributed throughout the country. It seems that a new democratic regime has been born today in the New World. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL48.A;Vive le Libérateur, sauveur de la démocratie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.T;The Plan of Saxi-Bourdon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.D;The rats burrows of treason reached far deeper than even de Aigle expected. It is now clear that the introduction of Atlantia into Lotharingia fatally undermined the political consensus which de Aigle had cultivated since the inauguration of his rule. Their innovative ideology and radical ways seeped into the national fabric, turning moderates into liberals, liberals into radicals, radicals into revolutionaries. And that is, today, what has broken out : a revolution, against de Aigle and the autocratic rule which he stands for. The treasonous liberals have assembled in New Alsace, long a center of emerging liberal thought, and have denounced de Aigles rule as the rampant despotism of a grasping tyrant! Atlantia and New Alsace have joined forces in preparation to overthrow le Chef, outlining their justifications for ousting him and their intentions to create a liberal, democratic republic in their Plan of Saxi-Bourdon. All of Lotharingia shall soon be ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.A;May there be a Hell for you, Atlantians - a Tartarus, bleak and unending!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL49.B;De Aigle's reign must end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL50.T;The Lotharian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL50.D;Chef de Aigles one-man rule of Lotharingia has finally pushed his enemies to the breaking point. The influx of Atlantian wealth and ideas has given liberals the resources they needed to finally mount a challenge to his control of the republic, rallying all those who oppose him, whether for reasons of ideology or out of personal vengeance. The New Alsatians and Atlantians have castigated de Aigle and everything that he stands for, decrying him as brute, a dictator, a Caesar, whose endless pursuit of power has brought calamity to the people and toxicity to the national soul. Lotharingia has now been ripped in half between those who stand by de Aigle and abhor the dawn of liberalism, and those who hail Atlantias dreams of liberty as the future of the nation. All of Ameriga watches as the fate of the continent hangs in the balance, caught between Lotharingia and New Alsace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL50.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL51.T;Victory of de Aigle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL51.D;It seems that all of the money in the world could not allow the Atlantians or the New Alsatians to obtain victory. de Aigle has shattered the liberal insurrection, and his total domination of Lotharingia is now unquestioned. As his troops sweep across towns and cities throughout the north, all enemies of the regime are being seized for questioning, trial, and punishment. Though the torch of liberty seems to have been extinguished in Lotharingia, Le Chef is unworried : the destiny of a proud nation  HIS nation  awaits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL51.A;Vive le Chef!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL52.T;Northerners' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL52.D;Le Chef is no more! De Aigles rule of Lotharingia has finally been ended, broken by the might of New Alsace and the guile of Atlantia. The former dictator was found dead in his office, pistol clutched in his hand. While he may have escaped true justice, many more of his accomplices and lower-ranking followers shall face trial for the injuries they inflicted upon the republic. A new day dawns over Lotharingia : one of democracy, of the people, by the people, and for the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL52.A;Sic semper tyrannus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL53.T;The Atlantian Takeover;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL53.D;To the bewilderment of all of Ameriga, neither de Aigles Lotharingia nor the liberals New Alsace were able to achieve a decisive advantage over the other. After a bitter peace of status quo was hammered out between the two states, it appears that the Atlantians have decided to take matters into their own hands. The New Alsatian government has been forcibly deposed by a private army of Atlantian mercenaries, and Atlantia has assumed direct control of what used to be northern Lotharingia. Though the new Atlantian regime promises to continue to protect democracy, the fact that its rebirth was tainted by the original sin of New Alsaces overthrow shall haunt the republic forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL53.A;If you want something done right, you must do it yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL54.T;De Aigle Criticized;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL54.D;A few years ago, criticism of Chef de Aigle wouldve been unthinkable. With his vast network of agents strewn throughout the country, nobody wouldve dared say anything seriously damaging about him, not to anyone except those that they absolutely trusted. Yet recently, a strange mood has come over Lotharingia : that of dissent. In meeting houses and in taverns, in marketplaces and in alleyways, de Aigle and his government have begun to be questioned with unprecedented intensity. More and more people are beginning to take issue with his rule : with his suppression of democracy, with his management of the economy, with his control of the media, with his ban on public meetingsThe list goes on, a litany of complaints against his dictatorship, and though our brave police try to squash what they can, the whispers keep coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL54.A;Be silent! I command it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL55.T;A Plan for Peace in Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL55.D;It appears that Chef de Aigles grip on Lotharingia is finally beginning to weaken. Criticism of his rule has begun to grow to unprecedented levels, as our agents within the country have reported. This is an excellent opportunity to fuel such discontent, and fan the flames of popular anger towards him until his regime finally collapses. After that, why, it would only be the humane thing to do to protect whatever emerged from the destruction of the dictatorship. The simplest method of doing this would be to help discontented areas of Lotharingia push for greater autonomy  the more autonomy the better. Let us convene a meeting in Varennes to broach the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL55.A;This is for the greater good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.T;The Varennes Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.D;De Aigle was merely concerned when he heard that more and more people were beginning to repudiate the regime. When he heard that the governors of New Alsace and Odonia had begun to speak out against him, however, he grew furious. Yet both governors maintain control of a local militia, as is standard for internal peacekeeping, and lately they seem to have received outside help in outfitting it to be more akin to a true army. With the sudden threat of civil war, the Atlantians have stepped into the picture, offering to hold a conference in Varennes to discuss a diplomatic solution. What they proposed to de Aigle, however, shocked him : the full autonomy of New Alsace and Odonia, with le Chef allowed to dictate their foreign policy but with their respective governors in full control of their domestic policies. Both men seem to be recent converts to Atlantian liberalism, yet this could relieve the burden on de Aigles government and allow them to focus more on suppressing dissent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.A;What has become of me? Oh, very well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL56.B;Ridiculous! I still have my pride!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL57.T;The Varennes Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL57.D;Though Chef de Aigle was bitter about the decision, he finally decided to relent and accept our proposal for the federalization of Lotharingia. While this will probably allow him to more efficiently crack down on liberalism within his remaining directly-ruled lands, New Alsace and Odonia both seem set to become islands of liberty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL57.A;A blow to his regime nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL58.T;Failure of the Varennes Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL58.D;Chef de Aigle was hostile to us from the moment that he heard that Atlantia sought to get involved in Lotharian affairs. When he heard our proposal for federalization, he grew utterly outraged. Denouncing us as loathesome butchers and a gang of unwashed thieves, he quickly departed from Varennes, hurling invectives as he left. It seems that Lotharian federalization is dead in the water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL58.A;Was it something that we said?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL59.T;Plotters Everywhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL59.D;The aftermath of the Varennes Convention has seen Lotharingia dive further into instability. New Alsace has begun to protest de Aigles management of the economy, arguing that free trade would benefit the country reap greater rewards in the long run  they probably also have an eye to their domestic markets. Meanwhile, de Aigles continued tendency to promote friends and other members of the old guard to positions within the military is causing younger officers to chafe, upset that they have been passed over. Furthermore, many young officers frequently find their salaries skimmed, meaning that not only are they denied the promotions with larger salaries, but the money they do receive is even less than it ought to be. As if this werent enough, reports are coming in that the Guarani tribes to the west are beginning to launch probing attacks into villages, or accosting officials who enter their territory. If someone were to unite them, they might prove a force to be reckoned with. Lotharingia is slowly descending into chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL59.A;Everything is under control! I swear it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL60.T;Our contacts in Nouvelle-Alsace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL60.D;We have made contact with several New Alsatian nationalists, who have expressed dissatisfaction with the Lotharian regime, with particular emphasis on their distaste for de Aigle. If we were to support them in an uprising against Lotharingia, we might be able to gain enough leverage to forc  to persuade them to join our nation instead, with considerable autonomy of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL60.A;We shall try our best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL61.T;The New-Alsatian Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL61.D;Over the past few years, New Alsace has become quite dissatisfied with de Aigle. The region has accused him of stifling economic growth due to his protectionist policies, along with exploiting local businesses to fill his coffers and generally neglecting local needs. This was seen as mere grumbling, but de Aigles informants have reported that several outspoken New Alsatian nationalists have been meeting with notable Atlantian politicians and businessmen. This conspiracy has now burst forth into open rebellion, as New Alsace declares independence with Lotharingia! Atlantia has rushed to support them, proclaiming their solidarity with the New Alsatian traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL61.A;How DARE they!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL62.T;The Jeune Lotharians' Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL62.D;The New Alsatian secession has finally destroyed de Aigles credibility with many military officers. Their careers sabotaged by corruption, thoroughly disgusted at de Aigles unilateral refusal to ever compromise, and with plenty of ambition, the Ligue de Jeunes officers Lotharien or simply the Jeune Lotharians has finally made its move. As de Aigle was finishing breakfast in his presidential palace, a team of mutineers infiltrated through the servants' entrance, then fought their way through the building. De Aigle barely had time to flee, leaping out of the window and into a nearby tree before commandeering a stagecoach and departing the capital just before the Jeune Lotharians were able to seal it off. Much of the country is now under the Jeune Lotharians control, and they have promised to restore stability to the nation. However, not everyone has defected to the rebels - de Aigle still has powerful friends in Odonia, the southern state where he was born, and where he has now fled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL62.A;Viva les Jeunes Lotharians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL63.T;The Secession of Odonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL63.D;It was obvious that de Aigle would take action against the Jeune Lotharians as soon as he was able. Having arrived in Odonia, he contacted regional politicians, businessmen, and military officials across the area, and rapidly gained their allegiance. All of Odonia has now broken away, as de Aigle declares a state of insurrection in Lotharingia and New Alsace and prepares to use what limited resources he has to attempt to reconquer both. It is also believed that de Aigle may attempt to call in help from a third party : the Beornians, whose ruler, King Edward, has long been an acquaintance of de Aigle. Yet the presence of Anglo-Lotharians in Odonia and de Aigles position of weakness may make such a gamble even riskier than le Chef believes. Whatever the case, the country has now fractured even more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL63.A;He can run, but he can't hide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL63.B;Vive le Chef! Vive Odonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL64.T;An Appeal to Beornia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL64.D;The Beornians under King Edward have become the closest thing a man as paranoid as de Aigle has to an ally. Admiring their stability under the monarchy and the unified sense of allegiance which they hold towards their sovereign, de Aigle and King Edward have found some common ground over the years, even if they wouldnt consider themselves close friends. This gives us an opportunity to obtain aid from Beornia against the New Alsatians and the Lotharian nationalists. However, it is a dangerous request to make towards Beornia. There is a reason that de Aigle has never allowed himself to grow too close to King Edward : the presence of Anglo-Lotharians, Lotharians of Beornian descent, in Odonia and other border regions. Beornian nationalists have long advanced territorial claims against Lotharingia on these grounds, and it is not out of the question that King Edward might seek concessions from de Aigle in return for his services. Yet in this desperate hour, what choice do we have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL64.A;It is a risk that we must take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL64.B;Le Chef has been backstabbed enough, forget it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.T;Edward's Choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.D;The blunders of Chef de Aigle, dictator of Lotharingia, have finally exploded in his face, as New Alsace secedes with Atlantian aid, Lotharingia proper falls to a military clique, and Odonia becomes le Chefs last refuge. As he prepares to attempt destroy both the liberals and the nationalists, he has appealed to King Edward on the grounds of their mutual friendship and political interests to aid him, arguin that a victory by either rebel faction would be disastrous for both Lotharingia and for Beornia. After receiving this news, the Kings advisors have weighed in on the matter. Many argue that we should at least demand the western part of Odonia in return for aid, as it has a sizable Anglo-Lotharian minority. Jingoists declare that, as de Aigle has proven himself incapable, we should engineer a coup in Odonia and seize control of the whole region. Some urge Edward not to get involved at all, claiming that Beornia should not drain its resources fighting in a foreign war. What is the will of the King?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.A;We demand Transfleuve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL65.B;Contact the Anglo-Lotharians, de Aigle is not needed anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL65.C;We can't take a side against the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL66.T;Promising Transfleuve;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL66.D;King Edward has agreed to help us, on one condition : the transfer of Transfleuve, a region with an Anglo-Lotharian minority, to Beornia. We are not in a position to refuse, and so le Chef has reluctantly conceded to this demand in order to secure Beornias aid. After all, De Aigle tells himself, just because he agrees now doesnt mean that he must follow through...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL66.A;A small price to pay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL67.T;The Lotharian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL67.D;Lotharingia, so long Chef de Aigles private fiefdom, has finally crumbled under the weight of his autocratic rule. The Atlantians have fomented a liberal revolt in New Alsace, and the region shall surely align with their interests if it is allowed to endure. Lotharingia proper has been seized by the Jeune Lotharians, a group of young, nationalist military officers seeking to chart a new course for the nation without de Aigles despotism. Le Chef himself has fled to Odonia in the south, and defiantly declared his intent to crush both the New Alsatians and the insurrectionary Jeune Lotharians. Like the Romans of old, de Aigles bid for imperium has given rise to those who would see him cast down. The future of Lotharingia is unclear, but one thing is certain : it shall be written in blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL67.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL68.T;The Assassination of de Aigle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL68.D;De Aigle was relieved when a column of Beornian troops, escorted by Anglo-Lotharian volunteers, approached his field headquarters  presumably to place themselves under his command, or at least to confirm their new alliance. It was therefore an utter shock when they opened fire, decimating the Odonian loyalists! De Aigle, with no time to flee, was cut down where he stood by a volley of rifle shots, and many of his supporters were killed as well, with the survivors arrested to prevent them from spreading news of de Aigles assassination. As Beornian troops and their collaborators fan out across Odonia, Anglo-Lotharians have been foisted into positions of power throughout the region. The head of the Beornian contingent has proclaimed a new government , the Grand Duchy of Odonia, and declared it to be a Beornian vassal. This intrigue has not halted the grinding turn of the gears of war, but it has most certainly astonished all involved, save the loyal subjects of His Majesty the King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL68.A;Long live Royal Odonia and God Save the King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL69.T;The Lotharian Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL69.D;Lotharingia, so long Chef de Aigles private fiefdom, has finally crumbled under the weight of his autocratic rule. The Atlantians have fomented a liberal revolt in New Alsace, and the region shall surely align with their interests if it is allowed to endure. Lotharingia proper has been seized by the Jeune Lotharians, a group of young, nationalist military officers seeking to chart a new course for the nation without de Aigles despotism. Le Chef himself fled to Odonia in the south, and defiantly declared his intent to crush both the New Alsatians and the insurrectionary Jeune Lotharians, but King Edward of Beornia had other plans. Working with Anglo-Lotharians in Odonia, the Beornians assassinated de Aigle and took control of the region for themselves. Like the Romans of old, de Aigles bid for imperium attracted both domestic rivals and foreign intruders, and the nation that he built is now under siege from within and without. The future of Lotharingia is unclear, but one thing is certain : it shall be written in blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL69.A;We shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL70.T;The Aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL70.D;The dust has settled upon Lotharingia. Though thousands upon thousands of lives have been lost, today a new day dawns upon southeastern Ameriga. The victors shall surely reshape the nation in their image, as the ideologies of the vanquished are cast into the ashes of history. Perhaps a new generation shall rise to advance them once more in the future, but for now, Lotharingia and its fate are in our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL70.A;We shall steward it well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATL71.T;The Aváni Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL71.D;The Guarani peoples of the western interior have been getting restless lately, but since they were largely divided into different tribes without much coordination or leadership, they did not pose a serious threat. The situation has now changed. Nheçu Tumpa, a Guarani chieftain and shaman, has unified the tribes after both a string of victories against Lotharian patrols and a series of messianic visions in which he proclaims that Nhanderuvuçu, supreme god of the Guarani and the Tupi peoples, has entrusted him with liberating the Guarani. Nheçu has thus proclaimed the realm of Avá, and has declared that, while he shall allow democracy and henceforth retain only religious duties, anyone of European descent who trespasses into Avá shall be struck down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL71.A;What madness is this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.T;Ceding Transfleuve;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.D;As promised, now that the civil war is over, we must cede Transfleuve to Beornia in reward for their assistance. But, must  is that not a strong word to use? Who says that de Aigle must do anything? By what right do they seek to compel le Chef to submit to them? Perhaps we could refuse. Perhaps we could fight them, and beat them, too! Perhaps;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.A;...no, there's been enough bloodshed. Cede it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL72.B;It is time to alter the deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL73.T;Lotharingia Cedes Transfleuve;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL73.D;As promised, now that the civil war is over, Lotharingia must cede Transfleuve to us in reward for our service. They have complied, and our administration has already taken possession of the territory. Though it might be a bit troublesome to integrate, we shall make the effort, for God, for King, and for Country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL73.A;Hail Beornia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL74.T;Lotharingia Refuses to Cede Transfleuve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL74.D;We had suspected that Chef de Aigle, power-mad as he is, might seek to betray our agreement which brought him the aid in the Lotharian Civil War that de Aigle so desperately needed. This has now come to pass, with de Aigle angrily denouncing our attempts to dismember Lotharingia so soon after our struggle. Unfortunately for him, we have his signature on the treaty by which he promised to cede Transfleuve to us, and we have wasted no time in publishing it. The whole text is now being read in newspapers from here to Copenhagen, and de Aigle has been revealed as a duplicitous oath breaker. In the eyes of the international community, Lotharingias claims to Transfleuve are forfeit, whereas ours are now indisputable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL74.A;Did he truly believe that he could get away with this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL80.T;The Burgundian Royal Family;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL80.D;Few could imagine such a fate for the royals of Burgundy : a Republic has been established in Anvers, leaving them without a throne to sit on and exiled by the decree of those now in power. While many thought to stay in Europe among their allies, Prince Jean has decided to settle in Lotharingia, the country he felt the most kinship with. He was welcomed in Fort Lothère by De Aigle in person as both were happy to remind the world of the shared legacy of Burgundy in the western hemisphere. Already he and his family have settled in a villa near Douancy, having pledged to not influence politics but live a socialite life on the coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL80.A;How far they have fallen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL81.T;The Prince in Exile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL81.D;The affairs of our former overlord have been the first subject of conversation in Lotharingia for months. The clash between the Burgundian Royalists and the Parliamentarians have been heavily documented, both in the press and in the cafés, while emigrants fleeing the Civil War arrive at our shores in search of a new life in Ameriga. The success of the Parliamentarians and the exile of King Jean have been celebrated by many, especially the Atlantians. But yesterday, a dashing figure has appeared in the port of Fort Lothère. Prince Jean the Younger, son of Burgundys former autocrat, has fled to our shore as a simple citizen searching for a new life following the demise of his father. None know his intent, but he has been welcomed by exiled Burgundian conservatives and the Board of Immigration has seen no problem with his bid for citizenship;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL81.A;Even royals want to live in the New World!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL82.T;Jean Enlists in the Lotharingian Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL82.D;Prince Jean, or simply Jean Bouillon as he prefers, has joined the ranks of the Lotharingian army yesterday, to the general apathy of the country which simply does not care much for the fate of an exiled Burgundian prince. Nonetheless, Jean Comte, journalist for the Temps dAmérigue, has covered the incorporation of the royal veteran in the army. Prince Jean did indeed fight in the Civil War, although Liberals argue it was only as a colonel in a tranquil countryside, and the Lotharingian generals were happy to get some noble blood in charge of one of their regiments. When asked why he decided to enlist for a country that his forefathers fought, he was quoted saying that he came from a bloodline of warriors, and only iron and blood could make him worthy of their legacy, whether or not it was under the Burgundian flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL82.A;In Fort Lothère you can be a new man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL83.T;The Battle of Rivière du Sang;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL83.D;Yesterday, a contingent of 50 men patrolling a remote river in Guarani territory was assailed by a tribe who had resisted previous Lotharingian visits and encroachment upon their territory. The battle began badly, as the rear guard was assaulted and split from the rest of the force. However, Prince Jean Bouillon, leader of the expedition, saved his fellow soldiers and forced the tribe to retreat before burning their village and planting the Lotharingian flag upon its ashes. This story has made the dashing young prince a national hero, notably thanks to the report of his friend the journalist Jean Comte.\n\n Several experts on the Guaranis have expressed their doubts at the whole story, for this tribe had not posed any problems before the arrival of the Prince, but with no survivors it seems the official story is the only story.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL83.A;Who doesnt love the story of valiant young princes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL84.T;Jean the Brave;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL84.D;The renown of Jean Bouillon has only grown following his success in Guarani territory. Appointed as advisor to the Minister of War, he has gained a post in the capital and has begun to oversee vast reforms, such as mandating mess halls for barracks and implementing more egalitarian conscription policies by forcing priests and young bourgeois students to serve in the national army. Many soldiers and nationalists have taken to singing Notre Prince dAmérigue, a popular song that was written following his exploit on the Blood River, and his portrait is often seen adorning the interior of military cafés and bars. Most importantly, it is said that Jean Bouillon was admitted in the Ariraboua Club, securing his relation with Atlantian elites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL84.A;A brilliant career awaits him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL85.T;The Medals Scandal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL85.D;The highest order of merit in Lotharingia is the Libérateur De Aigle medal, awarded to those deemed worthy of recognition for great military deeds in service of the Republic of Lotharingia. The Order has been awarded with increasing frequency over the years, but few questioned this, simply assuming that more Lotharingians were serving their country with the highest zeal. But yesterday, the front page of Le Temps dAmérigue broke the news of a national scandal, as Lotharingian President Mathieu Schoelcher was revealed to be selling the medals for his own personal gain! The Ministry of War documents published in the article were confirmed as genuine by the National Assembly and many have called for the President to resign and face trial. Faced with no other option, Schoelcher resigned today, calling for new elections to be organized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL85.A;A shocking affair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL86.T;Bouillons Candidacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL86.D;It came as a surprise to no one when Jean Bouillon declared his candidacy for President of Lotharingia. Running as an independent and having built up a sizable amount of support with the lower class and the army, he also has friends in the press and industrial milieux. Moreover, his fellow members of the clandestine Amerigan Society have approved of his candidacy, as they admire his bellicose approach to unification of the Southern continent and he has made no secret over the years of his support for Liberal ideas. With the political scene empty following the resignation of the once popular Schoelcher and the scandals tainting of his party colleagues, it seems he will have no problem securing the Presidency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL86.A;President and Prince?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL87.T;From volunteers to soldiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL87.D;The Golden Board of Atlantia hardly maintained a force because of its neutrality. But in the 1820's, with the independence of Lotharingia and Amazonia, the Gobernador Luis de Laserna decided to authorize the creation of volunteer forces and bought artillery from Spain to protect the cities from any threat. These Volunteer forces were soon organized by a newly arrived German baron, Jonathan Zweibrücken, who renamed himself Deuxponts, into a Volunteer army. With the independence, Jonathan was given command of all forces and helped secure Atlantian independence. His reforms have transformed the militias of old into the mightiest force of the continent and he has been chosen to be the first recipidient of the Order of the Atlantian Cock, the highest decoration of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL87.A;Everyone give it up for Amerigan favorite fighting German!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.T;The Presidential Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.D;The election has seen Jean Bouillon, the former heir to the Burgundian throne and now a national hero of Lotharingia, dominate the electoral scene. No candidate could secure a network as powerful as his among the men of money and industry, nor match his fame with the lower classes. His platform of anti-corruption and Pan-Ameriganism is seen as a populist one, and despite his famous reputation, many accuse him of being a glory hound without any real plan or vision. Nonetheless, as the results are called it seems that;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.A;Jean Bouillon is the new President!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL88.B;Another candidate managed to secure the Presidency!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL89.T;An Ultimatum to the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL89.D;Jean Bouillon ran his campaign on a general Pan-Ameriganism platform and has worked to secure the domination of Lotharingia over the whole continent. Amazonia has been a particular target for nationalists over the years as Atlantians argued that the reorganized Lotharingia had a moral duty to reorganize the North and shatter the planters power. President Jean has agreed that Amazonias condition can no longer be tolerated and has decided to issue an ultimatum to them : lay down their arms and integrate into a Federation with Atlantians and Lotharingians, or face the wrath of the Southern armies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL89.A;We await their response...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.T;An Ultimatum from Lotharingia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.D;Jean Bouillon, once heir to the Burgundian throne and now a famous exile in Lotharingia, has rapidly gathered public support to the point of winning the Lotharian presidential election. He campaigned on a platform of pan-Ameriganism, and he has now put his beliefs into practice  by force. We have received a demand from President Bouillon, demanding that we lay down our arms and enter a new Amerigan Federation along with Atlantia and Lotharingia, or face invasion! Many ministers are astonished, bewildered, or outraged, and the whole executive branch has been thrown into chaos. A few optimistic cabinet members declared it to be a hoax, only for border guards to report Lotharian troops massing nearby. The news shall surely go public at any moment, either from our own disclosure or from the first Lotharian assault. We must decide how to react and we must decide now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.A;They want our arms? Come and take them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL90.B;Well, gentlemen, here's to Ameriga...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL91.T;They Refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL91.D;The response from Amazonia was curt and simple : If you want our arms, come and take them. It seems that one last war must be fought for the fate of Ameriga.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL91.A;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL92.T;They Accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL92.D;Success! Amazonia recognized that they could not hope to resist us, and bowed before our might. Without firing a shot, President Jean Bouillon has secured the entirety of Amazonia. Pan-Ameriganists rejoice across the nation, and Nouvelle Amsterdam in particular rings out with joyous praise of the President as Bouillon turns to his next order of business : preparing the announcement of Amerigan unification. Yet, even after all of the wild and fantastic turns of his life, he has one last surprise planned for the Amerigan people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL92.A;And now, a tour of the nation - and then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL93.T;Jean I, Emperor of the Amerigans;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL93.D;"For the past week, I have toured our great nation, and seen its verdant jungles, great mountains, vast plains, thriving cities, and all who live there. I have done this so that I may know the condition of the land, and the needs of its people. This has been accomplished, but far more importantly, it has impressed upon me the anxiety of the nation. Never have a people testified with such earnestness, passion, and clarity, as those I have encountered who have expressed a unanimous need for security of leadership. Ameriga today encompasses me with her sympathies because I am not a mere dreamer. I have, through the energies of my labor and those who have labored together with me, brought forth the unification of our people. Do not mistake me for an autocrat, for I am first a shepherd. In order to benefit the country, it is necessary not to wield the mailed fist, but rather to bear the torch of inspiration to light the way for its people. It is for all these reasons that I stand before this nation today as its first Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
ATL93.A;And so an empire is born.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Burning_New_Amsterdam_title;The Burning of Nouvelle Amsterdam;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
Burning_New_Amsterdam_desc;Although Atlantia has always been a precious province within our nation thanks to its gold, it was also always a haven for free-thinkers and dissidents. We know those damn Atlantians are responsible for the struggles our nation endured! They will continue to be a thorn in our side and our great union until we root them out from this city! Street by street we will search their houses, their estates and find those damn conspirators! We will not compromise once more with dissidents!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

prospect_Atlantia_desc;As our commercial and industrial prowess continue to improve, a recent investiture in the Hinterlands of Atlantia has once more, proven fruitful! With a new drilling process & advancements in mining, we can reach deeper then we had ever before, and not only will our Gold mines be viable, but prospects of Iron has lead to many of our economists to dictate a new era of home industry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT_coal_title;The Lotharingian coal fields;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
LOT_coal_desc;Since the beginning of the 19th Century, we have been aware of the prize of coal underneath Domecy & Riel-Conde, but, both the locals & investors have lacked the will or proper confidence to ever invest in it with a guarantee of profit. With the advent of Coke, however, it seems that eyes are now turning to the deposits of potential coal industry across Ameriga. With just a little nudging in the right direction, we can see a fledgling coal industry on our very land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
integrate_NMC_title;Integrate New Mercia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
integrate_NMC_desc;We set up New Mercia as an autonomous region because of the time and efforts needed to cross the Andes. But as technology progress, this divide becomes more and more inefficient and we can easily administrate Edward's Landing as Camelot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AMA34.T;The city of Ploumanao ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AMA34.D;The great age of piracy in Ameriga had seen various Breton sailors join the pirates because of the suffering they endured on colonial ships. Infamous among them was Barba-Du, Black Beard who raided successfully several Spanish islands. In the XVIIth century, pirates and smugglers sailed the Amazon river to escape colonial authorities. There they established an outpost among the Manao people, later becoming the city of Ploumanao, which developed as a port of adventurers and escapees, developing their own dialect of Breton colored with the local Arauaki language. The Anglois and Spanish governors heard of the place, but none of the expeditions they sent could successfully claim the place and its people, defeated by the treacherous waters and tropical diseases along with political divisions as to whom the city belonged. Meanwhile the Bretons of the Jungle thrived, dealing regularly with merchants from Saint George. Eventually $COUNTRY$ managed to make them accept its domination in $YEAR$, but they would keep their particularism and their language well beyond the XXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AMA34.A;Breizh Nevez!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN1.T;The fate of Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN1.D;Southern Lotharingia has been taken back by our valiant troops, with the Anglican flag finally put down after all these years of pseudo-independence. We have taken back our land to see it filled with weird Protestant sects and powerful cattle owners styling themselves 'Barons', and one of the main reasons of their backwardness. \n \n Now is the time for us to decide how to administrate these lands and especially the property. The land here has been forcefully taken by a few landlords following the treacherous agreement of 1817 and we could take the occasion of the conquest to open the vast plains to foreign settlement, at the expanse of the locals' loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN1.A;We must respect the Southerners as full Lotharingian citizens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN1.B;We will force them to become part of the civilized world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN2.T;New Mercia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN2.D;New-Mercia has been for some years already integrated in our nation but the fact remains that Edward's Landing is not easily reachable. The Andine passes are scarce and not usable during winter, and many bureaucrats in our government prefer to round Land's End rather than take the land road. Already the frontier spirit has made the local Beornians quite different from their brothers and sisters across the Andes and it has been suggested that we could recognize a local autonomy to New-Mercia which could certainly help their development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN2.A;Set up a local government in Edward's Landing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN2.B;New Mercia is as Beornian as Camelot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN3.T;The English Monarchy in exile;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN3.D;Beornia is by all metrics the youngest nation in Ameriga. Even if technically independent earlier than Amazonia, this land was only settled by English settlers from the Lotharingian colony during the XVIIth century, crossing the Odon river and destroying the short-lived settlement of Argentine. Living in small towns often unknown by the Lotharingian governor, they developed a peculiar mindset of exiles distrustful of foreigners and keen to protect their language and culture. From that chaos, emerged strong landowners, that rule over the lands like feudal lords. One of them, Harold Cavendish proclaimed himself King 'of the house of England' in 1822. Now his son Edward rules, and the path of possibles is open for the young European-educated King who must choose between the traditional mindset of the Cattle Barons and the new ideas he learnt and practised in Prague and have become shared in the cities of the coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN3.A;Long live Beornia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN4.T;20 years of independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN4.D;Beornia was recognized as a separate entity in 1817 by the Charlemagne agreement that saw the colonial governor of Lotharingia agreeing to name the Cattle Baron Harold Cavendish, 'Lieutenant-Governor of the Crown colony of Southern Lotharingia'. While Beornia was only recognized independent in 1822 by the Lotharingian revolutionaries, it was the first act that split the lands across the Odon and the Bernicia from the rest of the colony. Not many celebrations were held, for the monarchy celebrates the Crowning of Harold rather than the agreement that allowed him to rise to power under Burgundian authority. But for Edward, who recalls these events as the reason for being sent away to the wonders of Europe, it seems that date was of special interest for he took the occasion to summon the rump Parliament in Camelot in two weeks for 'an important occasion'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN4.A;What does the young man want ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.T;The Parliament session;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.D;When Harold crowned himself King of Beornia in 1822, he decided to create a Parliament based on the English Parliament of old. But he never meant for the Commons and Lords to have but an advisory role, and he seldom summoned sessions. His son has seen much throughout Europe, in his years of studies, studying the Constitutions and seeing the ways of ruling. Edward has big plans for his country and has wondered for years how to realize them. Autocracy has its advantages and would placate the will of his uncle and the Cattle Barons but perhaps it is time that the Beornian Parliament becomes a true political power, on the Scandinavian or Burgundian model.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.A;The Rump Parliament confirms the absolute power of the King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.B;The Parliament is confirmed as a political power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN5.C;The King's government will now answer to the Parliament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.T;Industry in Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.D;Edward I took great interests in the steelworks of Prague and Anvers during his studies and was always impressed by the new forces of industry that could make small villages, new towns of steel and cement. But in Beornia, the new ideas spread slowly. The Barons of the interior which control nearly all lands in the interior have expressed disinterest or even hatred towards Europe and its new inventions, the most devout seeing it as a tool of the devil. The King has invited many European scholars and some of his old friends to implement changes, but his uncle Charles, leader of the Barons, has asked in a session of Parliament to focus the effort of the monarchy on the interior rather than spending time and money on fruitless efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.A;Barons are the past of this country, we must look to the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN6.B;We must tend to the earth to not lose the Beornian soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.T;The immigration bill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.D;Immigration to Beornia always was quite small. Few people were ready to leave Europe to end up in a poor and forgotten land and the Beornians only welcomed English among their own. The King has decided to regulate immigration formally but he has seen opposition from the old guard who holds true the words of the previous sovereign 'No tainted blood should spoil the virgin soil of our England in exile'. they ask that the Bureau of Immigration be used to ensure that only White Anglo-Saxon Protestants should be able to enter the country. A compromise faction wants to enlarge the criteria to include all Protestants, even not Germanic, while Liberals and captains of industry want to attract from everywhere in Europe, be they Jewish or Papists. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.A;Beornians can tolerate anyone, open immigration!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.B;We should ensure that no Papist set foot here but we will not look their ancestry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN7.C;English blood recognizes its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN8.T;The Gordon riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN8.D;The Immigration Bill had attracted vigorous criticism from the Church and the devout who saw the authorization of non-Protestant immigrants as a moral failure of the government and the King. Tensions have been high in Camelot for months, especially as the Bauernite preacher William Gordon denounced the Popish plot that had infiltrated the Beornian government to usher in the arrival of the Antichrist. they erupted in a violent pogrom as a Catholic mission was burnt and the priest beaten up and nearly hanged before the Royal men-at-arms could intervene. The demonstration could hardly be controlled by the police and it took the intervention of the regiments stationed in the capital to end the riots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN8.A;Beornia cannot change what it is by signing a piece of paper;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN9.T;The Camelot insurrection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN9.D;As the policies of the King followed the vision of his uncle Charles and more generally the Cattle Barons, the absolute and reactionary rule of the monarchy began to become more criticized in the coastal cities and the capital. Widely unpopular there, shadow conspiracies working with the bludgeoning docker and workers trade unions sought to destroy the monarchy and proclaim a Republic. Now the day has come, several quarters of the capital have risen up and the fate of Beornia seems undecided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN9.A;The Republic of Beornia is proclaimed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN9.B;The Monarchy defeats the seditious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN10.T;The Republic triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN10.D;The Absolutist rule of the Beornian kings has been widely criticized in Europe for decades, many agreeing that this rump country deserved such a government given its general population. But in a surprising move, parts of the armies rose against the monarchy in the capital and forced the King to flee to exile, proclaiming another free Republic in the New World!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN10.A;Long live the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN11.T;Victory of the Beornian Republicans;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN11.D;The Absolutist rule of the Beornian kings has been widely criticized in Europe for decades, many agreeing that this rump country deserved such a government given its general population. But in a surprising move, parts of the armies rose against the monarchy in the capital and forced the King to flee to the region of New Mercia where he has been hailed by the locals as the rightful King. The future will tell if the monarchy can endure in Edward's Landing or if the Republicans will march across the Andes to end the independence of their former colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN11.A;A sad victory ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN12.T;Victory of the Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN12.D;The Beornian capital lies in rubble as the army sweeps the last bastions of the insurrection that tried to overthrow King Edward I of Beornia. The Parliament has been purged from its seditious members and the government has been forced to acknowledge again the power of the King. It seems that Freedom does not flourish everywhere in the New-World;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN12.A;Long live Edward I!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN13.T;Victory of the house of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN13.D;The Beornian capital lies in rubble as the army sweeps the last bastions of the insurrection that tried to overthrow King Edward I of Beornia. The Parliament has been purged from its seditious members and the government has been forced to acknowledge again the power of the King. However the Republican cause is not all dead in the South of Ameriga : the autonomous region of New-Mercia has declared independence hearing about the massacres in Camelot and severed all ties with Beornia and the monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN13.A;Will they stay independent ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN14.T;Death of Charles of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN14.D;The last decades have seen a lot of changes in Beornia, often criticized by the Cattle Barons but nonetheless seen as needed by most of the population. Yesterday, the head of the aristocratic faction died. Brother and uncle to kings, Charles had incarnated the aristocratic stubbornness and was seen by many as a relic of the chaotic post-independence time. With their charismatic leader gone, most of the Cattle Barons and preachers from the interior have now decided to accept the new Beornia and it seems that tensions between the coast and the interior have declined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN14.A;A united nation is the best thing we can hope for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN15.T;The Barons' War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN15.D;The aristocrats of Beornia have been a thorn in Edward(s projects since his takeover. Among them his uncle has become a serious rival over the years, rallying devouts and aristocrats worried about the new course of things. Yesterday he and his followers marched on Camelot with several members of the armies joining the hero of independence on its way towards the Palace. Now Edward must choose between accepting the coup or fighting back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN15.A;The coup is crushed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN15.B;The Barons win;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN16.T;The Barons Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN16.D;Cattle Barons in Beornia have always been an important economic and political force in the country, refusing every attempt at modernizing and scrutiny from the government over their feudal ways. They attempted to have the King's uncle take power by a coup but were crushed in the attempt as Edward I refused to lay down his power. Now his uncle has been put under house arrest while many Barons had their lands confiscated and redistributed, securing the flame of freedom in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN16.A;Long live Edward and the Parliament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN17.T;The Barons War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN17.D;Cattle Barons in Beornia have always been an important economic and political force in the country, refusing every attempt at modernizing and scrutiny from the government over their feudal ways. Discontent with the King they marched on the capital with guns and loyal soldiers to coup the government and have the King's uncle Charles crowned. Edward accepted and signed his renouncement to the throne. Now Charles has embarked on a policy of renewed purity and faithfulness and has declared his intention to purge every seditious member from Beornian society. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Discontent with the King they marched on the capital with guns and loyal soldiers to coup the government and have the King's uncle Charles crowned. When they arrived, Edward had already fled on a ship to New Mercia where he was hailed as the rightful King when he arrived weeks after his uncle had been crowned in Camelot. Now Charles has embarked on a policy of renewed purity and faithfulness and has declared his intention to purge every seditious member from Beornian society, 'from one ocean to the next'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN19.D;'The Beornians are a'thick with red, from the flags they bear, to their clothes, to the very essence of their being. If you ever thought the vatican had their fair plate of the dye, then I'd say the Beornians got the whole pot.' \n\n Cochineal red has been our mainstay colour ever since James Oakes looted the insects & the dye from an incan outpost back in the 17th century, it has been perhaps, the one good mainstay of economic life for many smaller, sedentary families in the west of our country. It's bright colour, waving in every street of our cities, towns and villages. All who live in these great plains know that when the tide of red is on the horizon, you better be wearing red too. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN19.A;Better red then dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN20.T;A curious family reunion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN20.D;A rather bizarre story happened in Camelot as Jean de Courtenay, a French explorer on his way to the Pacific, was thrown out the Carter household. He said to have taken the opportunity to visit his distant cousins, claiming that the Carters were Courtenay who had survived the burning of Le Nouveau Havre in 1650. It came as a surprise to most because the Carters were regarded as true Englishmen : John Carter, a cattle baron close to the Royal family,  had formalized English grammar while his son and heir Alfred was a renowned historian on Anglo-Saxon times. To learn that an Anglois would try and slander their good name was the grievest insult they could have received and they acted accordingly, throwing him to the street and shouting at him until he left. Nonetheless, the claims of de Courtenay were validated years later in a famous history book on the Argentine colony that produced papers signed by Henri de Courtenay, the man that had betrayed the colony in exchange for a guarantee of protection for his properties. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN22.T;The Camblesforth raid;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN22.D;Life on the Beornian frontier can be harsh, as cattle herders and their families must face the hardships of the Beornian interior alongside the threat of the savages that squat the lands. Or so claims Charles of Beornia that was called to the capital by his nephew following the news of the Camblesforth raid. Producing several witnesses, he justified his expedition against a Mapuche tribe, claiming that he did what the Royal army could not do : protect innocent Christian folks from heathen demons. The court was especially moved by the fate of Amelia Goodman, who had been kidnapped by a Mapuche group and forced to marry by force his captor. Edward who had wanted to punish his uncle for the burning and massacre of an entire village to reduce his influence in the interiror was thus forced to accept the testimonies and let his uncle go, with even more popularity than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN22.A;He did well I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN23.T;Nemec Cotton;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN23.D;Wolfgang Nemec was a close friend of Edward he met in Prague during his study years in Europe. Last son of a Bohemian noble, he took an interest for cultivation during his youth and became one of the leading agronomic engineers in Europe. Visiting Beornia to look through the soils and the way to better cultivation in the kingdom of his old friend, he presented Edward with a plan to cultivate cotton as a new crop in the kingdom. Having studied suitable plots of lands in Eoferwic, Nemec was given by royal decree the empty fields to cultivate his cotton. Soon a great success, it however clashed with local gentry who had used these as grazing lands for their herds and tried several times to have the cotton removed for their own good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN23.A;Progress of industry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN24.T;A preacher's word;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN24.D;The Church of Beornia is a very decentralized Christian confession with a lot of variation in creed and practices throughout the Beornian parishes. The Anglican convention was established by the monarchy during independence to regulate the faith under the supervision of the King but it had few effects outside of urban parishes. For example, in the interior, the cult of Saint Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon King of England spread following the preaching of Branson Cromwell, a priest from Sharow. The convention tried several times to have him revoked but his charisma entitled him the support of his parish and the most devout throughout the country. One of his lasting legacy besides the cult of Harold was his insistence on marriage and births, claiming as Abraham was promised to have 'his seed greatly multiply as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore', it was needed by the Beornians to abide by the decrees of God and multiply so that their seed shall possess the gate of their enemies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

NAN25.T;Saltvick's method;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN25.D;Jonathan Saltvick was a member of the so called Edwardian circle, this gathering of various European nobles and bourgeois he had met during his studies and that he entertained over the years in Camelot or during his travels. An engineer from Scotland, he was responsible for determining that the river cities could utilise the river power to establish water mills by creating concentrated water flows and manipulating flood water with wheels. Having secured royal funding, he started in New Jerusalem a system of small-time businesses with semi-automated water-powered processes. Due to him, New Jerusalem boomed with Riverside businesses and his method became a common mark along the Silver River and a common sight in Beornian paitings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN25.A;Let money and water flow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN26.T;A mutinous welcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
NAN26.D;The Bounty was an Anglois ship from Liverpool that sailed from England in $YEAR$ to cross the Horn and sell goods in Zhourao. The captain, Auguste Blanc, a Frenchman, had hired a crew composed mostly of Englishmen notably for their small wages and directed the ship like a dictator. The crew conspired against him and had him put under the brig after he had one of his men whipped for having interpreted his talk in English to be an insult. The crew then sailed to New London where they were met as heroes by the population after their explanation of their act. The Beornian government had the ship and his goods given back to the armator but all the crew was given Beornian citizenry and they soon became national heroes proving that the English soul only waited a true English country to stir again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZFL1.T;La Petite Argentine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZFL1.D;;Amazonie does not have too many special holidays, but for one region in particular, today marks an important one indeed. The City of Le Nouveau Havre marks it's 200th Anniversary of the exodus of most of the families that inhabit the city from their original colony, renamed Camelot by the English that drove them out. The former Port, dedicated to the Anglois Silver Fleet, was under protected & undervalued by Anglois authorities, wanting to permit every last ounce of silver to come back to Europe. The colony was finally lost as the invading Beornians captured and looted the city in 1667 but its people carried with them their spirit and culture. The region of the Havre is known as the "Little Argentine", for that was the name of the Anglois colony and were you to ask how the inhabitants would identify themselves, they'd say proudly that they are Argentins. The only problem that arose was that a Beornian trader was thrown into the port -but saved by bystanders- as the crowd shouted 'On se souvient!' (we remember);;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF2.T;Rivenzi's Silk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF2.D;Matteo Rivenzi was an Italian immigrant from Lucca that ended up settling in Lotharingia after independence, fleeing political infighting in the Duchy as he has been a notable Republican during the Etrurian wars. A silk worker, he worked to introduce silkworms in Lotharingia and was successful in establishing a reliable silk industry in Transfleuve, being awarded a national award by De Aigle for having helped his country as a true Lotharian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF3.T;Le droit des vachers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF3.D;Cattle herding has been the economical backbone of the southern Lotharians, the figure of the vacher fighting for his freedom, being an important part of the national mythos. But as cities grow, cattlers old grazing grounds are bought by urban people and the rural herds are pushed more and more to the interior. A series of demonstrations took over the country as cattlers gathered their herds and marched into the cities to demand that their ancestral cattlers rights be respected by urban Lotharians and the authorities. The most known of these cattle demonstrations occured in $YEAR$ when the cattlers walked on Fort Lothère, severely disrupting the capital for several days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF3.A;That's a lot of manure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF4.T;Nouvelle-Anglie against Carijoux;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF4.D;The city of Nouvelle-Anglie was established in 1704 near Domecy by Anglo-Lotharian settlers on an island that had belonged to a Carijoux tribe. The Carijoux were promised by contract that the rights of their tribe would be protected but in 1785 they were killed and forced to flee from their homeland after an incident between a settler and a Carijoux ended up in a fight. They were marginalized and most thought that no New-Anglian would heard of them again. But in $YEAR$, Louis-François Carijien, descendant of the Carijoux tribe and respected lawyer decided to try the New-Anglia city for crimes against the rightful owners of the land. The jury ended up legitimizing the acts of the settlers against the tribe, but this was an affair that put the Natives' right in front of the national politics for years. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF4.A;Their legacy will not be forgotten;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF5.T;Le Sang de Juin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF5.D;Jacques Rosenthal is the most known Lotharian playwriter. Born in France, he had settled in Lotharingia to flee a duel prosecution and had created a big cultural scene in the capital, gathering artists and mecenas from the whole nation. But his latest work has provoked outrage in the devout. His playwright called 'The Blood of June' recalls a love-story between a Catholic woman and a Protestant man during the Anglo-French wars of religion. Mary and Joseph, the lovers of the play, end up separated by their respective families with Joseph being prosecuted by church authorities and condemned to the pyre. The play ends with Mary joining him on the pyre and their respective fathers lamenting on their acts. For Protestant devouts, this play is immoral and instills dangerous values for the youth of Lotharingia. As Rosenthal must face trial for blasphemy and immorality he is ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF6.D;When Didier Legrand toured Europe as was common for every young upper Lotharian he found a new passion in the horse tracks. When he came home he decided to fund the first Amerigan horse track. Located on one of his fields near Fort Lothère, it soon became a national attraction as the Lotharians horse owners competed against each other to gain the big prize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF7.T;Grande Patrie;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF7.D;'Great Motherland' was written during the Lotharian war of independence by the young poet Charles Dumas who died soon after being captured by loyalist forces. This poem remained mostly unknown until it was rediscovered by the opera writer Jean-Louis Mazel who put into music and made it the grand moment of his opera 'the rise of the Eagle'. Following the first representations, the song was widely popular and was played in many occasions by the general population. By the end of the XIXth century it had become as popular as the official anthem, the military march 'de l'independance' and would eventually be approved in $YEAR$ as the new anthem of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF7.A;Hail thee Lotharingia, my great land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF8.T;Henri Libre against Manfred Rosedan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF8.D;Henri Libre was one of the countless slaves freed following the abolition of slavery. Born in the plantation of Manfred Rosedan, he was punished for having tried to flee by his master personally with having one of his eyes gouged in public. Later in his life, he lost his left hand while operating the sugar mill. When he was freed, he appeared as a broken man, his corpse showcasing the abuses of slavery. The Negro Integration society decided to help him by putting his former master on trial. This became one of the most known trials of Lotharian society in $YEAR$ as it opened again the wounds of slavery. To add to the national importance of this trial, Rosedan was at the time mayor and soon to be nominated Senator thanks to his contacts in government. Eventually the judge decided that ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF9.T;Les Jaguars Noirs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF9.D;During the independence war, de Aigle had established the Légion Noire, a military force composed of Black freedmen to fight the Burgundians. A small force, derided by the upper staff, it attracted many unemployed Blacks following the abolition of slavery. The army counted on these units to serve as cannonfodder but they established a reputation for discipline and valor over the years. The 14th Lotharian regiment of the Légion Noire, known popularly as the Black Jaguars was thus the most distinguished Lotharian unit in the XIXth and early XXth century. The Jaguars Noirs ended up as a propaganda source in peace times showcasing the abilities of the Black people and their will to integrate in Lotharian society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

AZLF10.T;Oswald Oath;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
AZLF10.D;'Notre serment de loyauté à la Lotharie' was a famous pamphlet from the Anglo-Lotharian writer Charlie Oswald that was famously recognized as the cornerstone of Anglo-Lotharian integration. In his book, Oswald claimed that while they shared ties with their Beornian cousins, English people were as much a part of the Lotharian national fabric as Burgundians and that Lotharingia was now their new homeland. he called for his fellow Anglo-Lotharians to integrate even more into society and accept their shared legacy, especially in Odonia. Notably unloved in Beornia, it solidified the split between the Beornians and those they soon called 'Latin Saxons'. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

voc_annex_java_desc;The Terres Princières (Princely Lands) were three native states on the island of Java in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Indies that were nominally self-governing under the suzerainty of the VOC, two of the major states were the Sultanates of Yogyakarta and Bantam. Their political autonomy was however severely constrained by treaties and settlements. The princely territories were successor states to the Mataram Sultanate and originated in civil wars and wars of succession within the Javanese nobility.\n\nThe Terres Princières have long been under our protection. It would be in our best interests to convince them to come under our direct rule, so we might bring civilization to their people more effectively, and so that we might secure their lands from other powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

voc_short_declaration_desc;The Short Declaration (Courte Déclaration) was short and brief because it contrasted with the "long" contracts that were earlier concluded between the Burgundian Indies government and some seventeen so-called self-governing lands.\n\nThe latter were left under the charge of rulers who were empowered to deal with legislative and administrative matters pertaining to their territories, but they had to ensure that obligations to the Burgundian Indies government were met. The long contracts defined the limits of the competency of both rulers and the Burgundian Indies government.\n\nBy issuing the Short Declaration, we will declare these contracts null and void and we will bring the remaining princes under our direct control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333296.D;The Vereenigde Burgundische Oost Indsiche Compagnie (VOC) has been described as a cabal of merchants with a state. One of the wealthiest organizations in the world, it has turned its economic might into political and military clout, exerting administrative control and military might throughout the East Indies. While only a small population of Dutch and Burgundian traders form the core population, the obscene wealth of this merchant class allows them to maintain an iron grip on what is essentially a private colony. The VOC is an economic juggernaut, and its merchants hungrily seek any opportunity to further their own fortunes, no matter what it takes. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Citing obviously false examples of rampant corruption at every level of the Company, the Burgundian government has demanded immediate dissolution of our colonial administration, placing our Company lands under direct rule of the crown and relegating us to a purely financial role. Accepting would mean the immediate dissolution of our holdings in the East and reincorporation into the Crown. Refusing would surely mean escalation. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.A;We have no choice but to submit. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333285.B;We will not surrender our wealth and power! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.T;The Company Folds ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.D;In a rare moment of considering the good of the crown above their own profit, the VOC has agreed to our demands to relinquish control of the East Indies. The region will be directly administered as a crown colony, and the majority of company assets have been seized by the state. While the Company remains a powerful financial entity, their status as a semi-independent corporate nation has come to an end. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333301.A;Let them know their place. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.T;The East Indies Secession ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.D;The Burgundian East Indies Company has taken advantage of the situation in Burgundy to declare its full independence from its home nation and proclaim their sovereignty over the region. While Burgundy is not likely to let its crown jewel go without a fight, we can take advantage of this situation to proclaim our support for the Company, and gain influence over them to further our control of the East Indies. This move would certainly draw the Burgundian ire, but if we do not act it is likely another actor will take advantage of the situation. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.A;Declare our support and protection over the Company. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333286.B;The risks are too dangerous, do not intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.T;The Burgundian Secession ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.D;The Burgundian East Indies Company has taken advantage of the situation in Burgundy to declare its full independence from its home nation and proclaim their sovereignty over the region. While Burgundy is not likely to let its crown jewel go without a fight, we can take advantage of this situation to proclaim our support for the Company, and gain influence over them to further our control of the East Indies. This move would certainly draw the Burgundian ire, but it presents the opportunity to gain a strong ally in the region and place the Company in our debt. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.A;Declare our support and protection of the Company. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333287.B;This is too dangerous a move, do not intervene. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.T;New Foreign Sponsor ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.D;Through our diplomatic manoeuvring, we have found a new Great Power to sponsor and protect our fledgeling state. While some of our directors see this as trading Burgundian overlordship for another, this pragmatic move will help us maintain stability while we cement our rule. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333288.A;The most pragmatic option. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.T;We Stand Alone ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.D;Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to find a new European sponsor to protect us. While some scoff at the need for foreign overlords, without support from abroad we are in a tenuous position against Burgundy. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333289.A;Troublesome... ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.T;Intervention in the East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.D;The treacherous merchants of the East Indies company have managed to coerce another European power to protect them in exchange for influence. Our plans to reconquer them are in jeopardy, as to move now risks sparking a greater European conflict. We may continue to press our demands, but this would easily spiral into a greater war than we are prepared for. How shall we proceed? ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.A;No matter - the Indies will be ours again! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333290.B;We will bide our time... ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.T;Burgundy Withdraws ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.D;Burgundy has renounced its claims over the East Indies and we have forced them to acknowledge the independence of the East Indies Company. No longer bound to Anvers, we have secured our independence and our control of the East Indies! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333291.A;The spice will flow. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.T;End of the East India Company ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.D;After a protracted struggle, the East India Company has been forced to submit to us, and relinquish their control over the East Indies. Their colonial administration has been dismantled, and the region will be now ruled directly by the Burgundian government. With their primary colonial holding seized, the VOC's power has been broken, and they will never again challenge our rule. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333292.A;They have learned their place. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.T;Future of the East Indies ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.D;With our independence secured and Burgundy withdrawing from the East Indies, the time has come to consider the future of the region and our administration. One faction of the company believes that in order to survive, the native princes must be invited to form a modern government alongside the Burgundian administration, forming a native republic with a modern European foundation. A more reactionary faction believes that any level of reform is unnecessary, and that the Company can continue to rule as a corporate autocracy, run by and for the merchant class. While the long term stability of this move is questionable, the profit margin is undeniable. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.A;We cannot rule over a disenfranchised population - declare the Republic of Indonesia! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333293.B;We are free of all oversight - our wealth is all that matters! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333294.T;Military Support from Burgundy ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333294.D;A shipment has arrived from Burgundy, bringing the newest military developments from the homeland to our colonial administration. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333294.A;Power flows from the barrel of a gun. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333295.T;Commercial Support from Burgundy ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333295.D;A shipment has arrived from Burgundy, bringing new administrators and bankers with new schools of thought to our colonial administration. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
333295.A;Someone must count the coin. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3332960.T;Industrial Support from Burgundy ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3332960.D;A shipment has arrived from Burgundy, bringing the newest industrial tools and specialists from the homeland to our colonial administration. ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3332960.A;The roar of industry echoes! ;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
